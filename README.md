This website has short, self-contained descriptions of distriubuted algorithms and
additional supporting material such as videos, examples, self tests, and longer 
explanations. The website emphasizes the similarity of methods used to reason
about both sequential and distributed algorithms.
 
Informal algorithm descriptions allow reader to understand key ideas quickly.
The descriptions have enough detail to allow readers to construct formal
proofs. The website is used in undergraduate classes taken by students with an 
elementary knowledge of graphs.
