Which of the following are true? Try to answer these questions on your
own before looking at the answers.
<ol>
  <li>
  \(P \leadsto P\)
  </li>
  <li>
  \([Q \Rightarrow P] \;  \Rightarrow \; (Q \leadsto P)\)

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answers</h5>
All are true.

<ol>
  <li>
  \(P \leadsto P\)
  <p>
  In terms of paths from sets of states, there is a path of zero hops
  from every state to itself. So, there is a path from each state in P
  to a state in P.
  </li>
  <li>
  \([Q \Rightarrow P] \;  \Rightarrow \; (Q \leadsto P)\)
  <p>
  In terms of paths from sets of states, there is a path of zero hops
  from every state to itself. So, there is a path from each state in Q
  to a state in Q, and each state in Q is also in P.
  So, there is a path from each state in Q to a state in P.
  </li>
  <li>
 \( ((P \leadsto Q) \wedge [Q \Rightarrow R]) \; \Rightarrow \;
  (P \leadsto R)\)
  <p>
  In terms of paths from sets of states, there is a path from each
  state in P to a state in Q. Because \([Q \Rightarrow R]\), every
  state in Q is a state in R. So, there is a path from each
  state in P to a state in R.

<h4 style="color:red;">Example: State Transition Diagram</h4>

<figure>
  <img src="./Final_2022.004.jpg"

  <figcaption>Fig.1 Example</figcaption>
</figure>

This diagram shows a state transition system with states 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 and two actions shown as transitions colored blue and red. Our
convention in drawing these diagrams is that there is exactly one
transition for each action from each state, and if the transition is
not shown on the graph then that transition is from a state to
itself. For example, there is no red edge shown from vertex 5, and the
convention is that a red edge from vertex 5 back to itself is not
shown.

  </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answers</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
  What is always({3, 4, 5, 6})?
  <p>
  One way to find always(P), where P is a set of states, is to inspect
  each state in P in turn and determine if there is a path from that
  state to a state that is not in P. There is a path from vertex 3 to
  vertex 2 which is not in {3, 4, 5, 6} so, 3 is not in always({3, 4,
  5, 6}). Similarly 4 is not in always({3, 4, 5, 6}). All paths from
  vertices 5, 6 remain for ever in the set {3, 4, 5, 6}, and so 5, 6
  is in always({3, 4, 5, 6}). Therefore
  <p>
   always({3, 4, 5, 6}) = {5, 6}
  </li>
  <li>
  What is eventually({5, 6})?
  <p>
  Every state in P is in eventually(P). So 5, 6 are in
  eventually({5, 6}). We inspect each state that is not in P and
  determine if all fair paths from the state reach states 5 or 6.
  <p>
  A fair path which never reaches 5 or 6 is 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4,
  1,..... So, 1, 2, 3, 4 are not in eventually({5, 6}).
  <p>
  Therefore, eventually({5, 6}) = {5, 6}
  </li>
  <li>
What is eventually(always({3, 4, 5, 6}))?
  <p>
  always({3, 4, 5, 6}) = {5, 6}
  <br>
  eventually({5, 6}) = {5, 6}
  <br>
  So, eventually(always({3, 4, 5, 6})) = {5, 6}.
  <p>
  A vertex v is in eventually(always(P)) if every infinite fair path
  from v has the property that the path has a suffix (a tail) in
  which every vertex in the suffix is in P, i.e., a point in which the
  path enters P and remains forever thereafter in P. 
  </li>
  <li>
  What is eventually({1, 5, 6})?
  <p>
  The answer is obvious; however, I've gone into detail to illustrate
  how the four rules for proving leads-to are used.
  <p>
  {1, 5, 6} is a subset of eventually({1, 5, 6}). What about the other
  vertices?
  <p>
  Every red edge from {4}
  is to a vertex that is not in {4}. Therefore, fair paths that enter
  {4} will exit {4} eventually. (We could also have used the argument
  that every blue edge from {4} is to a vertex not in {4}.)
  <p>
  All edges from {4} are to {1, 5, 6}. Therefore, from the basic
  property, fair paths will not remain for ever in {4}, and when the
  paths leave {4} they enter {1, 5, 6}. So  {4} \(\leadsto\) {1, 5,
  6}.
  <p>
  {4} \(\leadsto\) {1, 5, 6} implies that {4} is a subset of 
  eventually({1, 5, 6}).
  <p>
  Using the basic property again, {2} \(\leadsto\) {1, 4, 5, 6}.
  Using the disjunction property and  {4} \(\leadsto\) {1, 5, 6}, we
  see that {2} \(\leadsto\) {1, 5, 6}.
  <p>
  Using similar arguments {3} \(\leadsto\) {1, 5, 6}.
  <p>
  Therefore, eventually({1, 5, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  </li>
  <li>
  What is always(eventually({1, 5, 6}))?
  <p>
  always(eventually({1, 5, 6})) =
  <br>
  always({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) =
  <br>
  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  </li>
  <li>
  What is always({1, 5, 6})?
  <p>
  always({1, 5, 6}) = {5, 6}
  </li>
  <li>
  What is eventually(always({1, 5, 6}))?
  <p>
  eventually(always({1, 5, 6})) =
  <br>
  eventually({5, 6}) =
  <br>
  {5, 6}
  </li>
</ol>


<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Proving \(\leadsto\) in a program</h4>

<i> Program P1</i>

<pre>
begin
   S0: NOT y   ->   y = True
   S1: y       ->   x, y = x+1, False
   S2: y       ->   x, y = x+1, True
end
</pre>

<i> Program P2</i>

<pre>
begin
   S0: NOT y   ->   y = True
   S1: y       ->   x, y = x+1, False
   S2: y       ->   x, y = x+1, True
   S3: y       ->   y = False
end
</pre>

<p>
S0, S1, S2, S3 are statement labels.
All commands are executed infinitely often.

<p>
Is the following statement true or false for each of programs P1 and P2?
<p>
\(
(x = 0) \; \leadsto \; (x > 0)
\)

<p>
Is the following statement true or false for each of programs P1 and P2?
<p>
\(
\forall n: (x = 0) \; \leadsto \; (x > n)
\)

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answers</h5>
For program <i>P1</i>:
<p>
For all statements s, and all n:
<p>
\(\{y \wedge (x = n) \} \; s \; \{ (y \wedge (x = n)) \vee (x > n) \} \)
<p>
There exists a statement (for example S2) which is executed infinitely
often where
<p>
\(
\{y \wedge (x = n) \} \quad S2 \quad \{ \neg (y \wedge (x = n)) \}
\)
<p>
From the above two formulae and the basic rule for \(\leadsto\):
<p>
\(
(y \wedge (x = n)) \; \leadsto \; (x > n)
\)
<p>
From the atomic property of \(\leadsto\) and because S0 is executed
infinitely often:
<p>
\(
(\neg y \wedge (x = n)) \; \leadsto \; (y \wedge (x = n))
\)
<p>
From transitivity of \(\leadsto\) and the above two formulae:
<p>
\(
(\neg y \wedge (x = n)) \; \leadsto \; (x > n)
\)
<p>
From disjunction of left-hand sides of \(\leadsto\) and because
\(
(x = n) \; \equiv \; ((x = n) \wedge y) \vee (x = n) \wedge \neg y)
\)
<p>
\(
(x = n) \; \leadsto \; (x > n)
\)
<p>
The formula holds for \(n = 0\), and so:
<p>
\(
(x = 0) \; \leadsto \; (x > 0)
\)
<p>
By induction on \(n\) and transitivity of \(\leadsto\):
<p>
\(
\forall n: \; (x = 0) \; \leadsto \; (x > n)
\)

<p style="color:red;">Program <i>P2</i></p>
These formula are not true for program <i>P2</i>. Here is an infinite
fair path in which \(x = 0\) at every state in the path.
<p>
Initially: y = true
<pre>
S3; S1; S2; S0;    S3; S1; S2; S0;    S3; S1; S2; S0; ...
</pre>

<p class="w3-text-teal">What part of the proof for P1 failed for
P2?</p>
<p>
The following triple does not hold for program P2.
<p>
For all statements s, and all n:
<p>
\(\{y \wedge (x = n) \} \; s \; \{ (y \wedge (x = n)) \vee (x > n) \} \)
<p>
Why?
<p>
Because with the above precondition for statement S3, the above
postcondition does not hold because \(x, y = n, False\).
