<p>
    This module introduces the temporal logic concept of
    <i>leads-to</i> and its basic properties.
</p>

    A message at the head of a channel from an agent \(A\) to an agent
    \(B\) is eventually delivered to \(B\). The message does not
    remain in the channel forever. The message at the head of the
    channel may be delayed for an arbitrary <i>finite</i> time, but is
    not delayed for infinite time. The concept of <i>leads to</i>
    captures the idea of a predicate holding "eventually."
    <p>
    Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be predicates. \(P \leadsto Q\) is a property
    of a system: a property is a boolean which either holds for the
    system or does not hold for the system. \(P \leadsto Q\) is read
    as \(P\) <i>leads to</i> \(Q\).

    <p>
    A trajectory is an infinite path through the state space which
    satisfies the condition that every message at the head of a
    channel is delivered eventually.
    

    <hr class="new2">
    <h4 style="color:blue;">
    <p>
    The property \(P \leadsto Q\)
    holds for a system exactly when any trajectory that visits a state
    in which \(P\) holds is at, or later visits, a state in which \(Q\)
    holds.
    </h4>
    <hr class="new2">

    The interval between the point at which the trajectory
    visits \(s\) and the later point at which the trajectory visits
    \(s'\) is finite.

    <p>
    For example, consider a trajectory, which is an infinite sequence of states,
    \(S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2},  \ldots\). If \(P\) holds in
    \(S_{i}\) and \(P \leadsto Q\) then there exists some \(j \geq i\)
    such that \(Q\) holds in \(S_{j}\). (Note that \(j\) could be equal
    to \(i\).)
    
    <h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    Consider a program
    <pre>
x = 0
while true:
    x = x + 1
    </pre>
    For this program, for all \(i, j\) where \(j \geq i\): \((x = i)
    \leadsto (x = j)\)
    
<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
A system has agents \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\). There are channels from
\(x\) and \(y\) to \(z\).
Execution of actions on channels are fair: If a channel has a message
then that message will be delivered eventually.

<p>
Agent \(z\) has a variable \(v\) which is
initially 0. If \(z\) receives a message from \(x\) before receiving a
message from \(y\) it sets \(v\) to 1.
If \(z\) receives a message from \(y\) before receiving a
message from \(x\) it sets \(v\) to 2.
The initial state <i>init</i> of the system has one message on each
channel from \(x\) to \(z\) and from \(y\) to \(z\).
<p>
Is the following true: \(init \; \leadsto \; (v = 1)\)?
<p>
No, because the message from \(y\) may arrive before the message from
\(x\).
<p>
Is the following true: \(init \; \leadsto \; (v \leq 2)\)?
<p>
Yes, because messages from \(x\) and \(y\) will arrive eventually.
    
    <h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    Consider a program
    <pre>
x = 0
while true:
    x = x + 2
</pre>
Does the following progress property hold for the system?
<p>
\(
(0 \leq x \leq 1) \quad \leadsto \quad (x = 3)
\)
<p>
No, because if \(x = 0\) then \(x\) never becomes \(3\). The
    definition of \(P \leadsto Q\) is that <i>ALL</i> paths from
    <i>ALL</i> states in which \(P\) holds eventually visit states
in which \(Q\) holds.

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
Does the following progress property hold for the system?
<p>
\(
(0 \leq x \leq 1) \quad \leadsto \quad (2 \leq x \leq 3)
\)
<p>
Yes. All paths from all states in which \(0 \leq x \leq 1\) eventually visit states
    in which \(2 \leq x \leq 3\).

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
Does the following progress property hold for the system?
<p>
\(
(0 \leq x \leq 1) \quad \leadsto \quad (2 \leq x)
\)
<p>
Yes. All paths from all states in which \(0 \leq x \leq 1\) eventually visit states
    in which \(2 \leq x\).

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
Does the following progress property hold for the system?
<p>
\(
(0 \leq x \leq 1) \quad \leadsto \quad (0 \leq x \leq 1)
\)
<p>
Yes. Any trajectory that visits a state in which \(0 \leq x \leq 1\)
at a point \(T\) <i>eventually</i>  visit states
    in which \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), because "eventually" includes the
possibility of immediacy.
    
<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
A system has agents \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\). There are channels from
\(x\) and \(y\) to \(z\). Agent \(z\) has variable \(xcount\) and \(ycount\) which are
initially 0. When \(z\) receives a message from \(x\) it executes:
<pre>
xcount = (xcount + 1) mod 10
</pre>
and when \(z\) receives a message from \(y\) it executes:
<pre>
ycount = (ycount + 1) mod 5
</pre>
<p>
In the initial state \(xcount, ycount\) are both 0. Agents \(x\) and
\(y\) send messages to \(z\) forever.
<p>
Is the following true: \(init \; \leadsto \; (xcount = 9)\)?
<p>
Yes
<p>
Is the following true: \(init \; \leadsto \; (ycount = 4)\)?
<p>
Yes.
<p>
Is the following true: \(init \; \leadsto \; (xcount = 9) \wedge
(ycount = 4)\)?
<p>
No. The state in which \((xcount = 9) \wedge (ycount = 4)\) may never
occur in a transaction.
    
<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Same agent structure as the previous example. The program for agent
\(z\) is as follows.When \(z\) receives a message from \(x\) it executes:
<pre>
if xcount < 10:
   xcount = xcount + 1
</pre>
and when \(z\) receives a message from \(y\) it executes:
<pre>
if ycount < 5:
   ycount = ycount + 1
</pre>
<p>
In the initial state \(xcount, ycount\) are both 0. Agents \(x\) and
\(y\) send messages to \(z\) forever.

<p>
Is the following true?
<p>
\(init \leadsto (xcount = 10)\)
<p>
Yes.
Is the following true?
<p>
\(init \leadsto always(xcount = 10)\)
<p>
Yes.
Is the following true?
<p>
\(init \leadsto always(ycount = 5)\)
<p>
Yes.
Is the following true?
<p>
\(init \leadsto always((xcount = 10) \wedge (ycount = 5))\)
<p>
Yes because eventually every trajectory that starts from \(init\)
visits and forever thereafter remains in a state in which
\((xcount = 10) \wedge (ycount = 5)\).
    
<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
What is the meaning of \(E(A(Q))\)?

<p>
A state \(s\) is in \(E(P)\) if and only if all trajectories that
visit \(s\) visit a state in \(P\) at or after it visits
\(s\).
<p>
Therefore a state \(s\) is in \(E(A(Q))\) if and only if all trajectories that
visit \(s\) eventually visit and remain forever in states that satisfy
\(Q\).

<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Is the following true?
<p>
\(
E(A(P)) \wedge E(A(Q)) \; \equiv \; E(A(P \wedge Q))
\)
<p>
A state \(s\) is in \(E(A(P)) \wedge E(A(Q))\) if and only if all
trajectories that visit \(s\) eventually visit and remain forever in states that satisfy
\(P\) and in states that satisfy \(Q\). Therefore if a state \(s\) is
in \(E(A(P)) \wedge E(A(Q))\) then it is also in \(E(A(P \wedge Q))\)
i.e.,
<p>
\(
E(A(P)) \wedge E(A(Q)) \; \Rightarrow \; E(A(P \wedge Q))
\)

<p>
The  converse,
<br>
\(
E(A(P \wedge Q)) \; \Rightarrow \; E(A(P)) \wedge E(A(Q))
\)
<br>

is also true because \(E\) and \(A\) are monotonic functions,
i.e. for any predicates \(R, R'\):
<p>
\(
[R \Rightarrow R'] \wedge E(R) \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(R')
\)
<p>
\(
[R \Rightarrow R'] \wedge A(R) \quad \Rightarrow \quad A(R')
\)

    

<hr class="new2">
    <h4 style="color:blue;">    
    We will almost always prove progress by proving a formula of the
    form:
    <p>
    \(
    P \leadsto \neg P
\)
<hr class="new2">
</h4>
    <p>
    which says that predicate \(P\) does not hold forever.
    <p>
    An
    example of such a formula is that a message \(M\) is at the head
    of a channel; that condition does not persist forever because the
message will be delivered eventually.
<p>
One way of proving that \(P \leadsto \neg P\) is to identify an action
    \(a\) such that if \(a\) is executed in any state in that
    satisfies \(P\) then the state when \(a\) terminates satisfies \(\neg P\).

    and any trajectory that visits a state in which \(Q\) holds, later

    then any trajectory that visits a state in which \(P\) holds, later
    visits a state in which \(R\) holds in a finite number of steps.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Disjunction left-hand side of \(\leadsto\)</h2>
    <p class="w3-text-teal">
    \(
    (P \leadsto R) \wedge (Q \leadsto R) \; \Rightarrow \;
    ((P \vee Q) \leadsto R)
    \)
</p>
The proof is straightforward.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Basic Property of \(\leadsto\)</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
Let \(R = P \wedge \neg Q\).
<p>
    \(
    (R \; \rightarrow \; (R \cup Q)) \wedge (R \; \leadsto \; \neg R)
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad (P \leadsto Q)
    \)
    </p>


  <p>
  <b>Proof outline</b>:
  \(R \; \rightarrow \; (R \cup Q) \) implies that every
  trajectory from a vertex in \(R\) either (1) remains in \(R\) forever
  or (2) visits a vertex in \(Q\). 
  But, \(R \leadsto \neg R\) implies that the first case is not
  possible. So, every trajectory from a vertex in \(R\) visits a
  vertex in \(Q\)
</p>
<p>
Trajectories from \(P \wedge Q\) are already in \(Q\), and therefore
  every trajectory from a vertex in \(P \wedge Q\) visits a vertex in
\(Q\).
The theorem follows from \(P =  (R \vee (P \wedge Q) \)


<figure>
  <img src="./BasicPropertyOfLeadsTo.jpg"
alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
  <figcaption>Fig.2 - Illustration of Basic Property of \(\leadsto\)</figcaption>
</figure>

    
<p>
We call this property the <i>basic</i> property because it is the
property on which most proofs of progress are based.
</p>

<p>
The left-hand side of \(\leadsto\) in the Basic Property has two
parts:
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Safety</i>: \(R \; \rightarrow \; (R \cup Q)\) which deals only
  with a transition from a state to the next.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Progress</i>: \(R \leadsto \neg R\) which says that \(R\) does
  not hold forever.
  </li>
</ol>


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Variant Functions and \(\leadsto\)</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
We use variant functions extensively in proving progress.
<p>
Let \(f\) be a variant function. So \(f\) is a function from states of
the system to a well-founded set.

The following theorem is an extension of the basic property. Let \(P\)
and \(Q\) be predicates

<p class="w3-text-teal">Variant Function Theorem<p>
\(\forall K: \quad 
P \wedge (f = K) \; \leadsto \;  (P \wedge (f < K))
\vee Q\)
<br>
\(\Rightarrow\)
<br>
\(P \leadsto Q\)

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The left-hand side of the implication is the following leads-to
formula: If \(P \wedge \neg Q\) holds  and the value of the
variant function is \(K\) in a state \(s\) then
all trajectories from \(s\) enter a state in which: (1) \(P\) holds and
the variant function value decreases or (2) \(Q\) holds.
<p>
Since the
value of the variant function can decrease only a finite number of
times it follows that 
<p>

\(
P \wedge (f = K) \quad \leadsto \quad Q
\)
<p>
Take the disjunction of the left-hand side of the \(\leadsto\) over
all \(K\) in the above equation to get: \(P \leadsto Q\).


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Useful way of Proving Progress</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
A convenient and useful way of proving \(P \leadsto Q\) is to use the
variant function theorem coupled with the basic property. This proof
has two parts:
<ol>
  <li><i>Safety</i>:
  The variant function doesn't increase until \(Q\) holds.
  </li>
  <li><i>Progress</i>:
  Eventually the value of the variant function changes or \(Q\) holds.
  </li>
</ol>
The second part uses concepts about progress such as \(\leadsto\),
whereas the first part only deals with transitions from a state to the
next state.


<figure>
  <img src="./InductionOfLeadsTo.jpg"
alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
  <figcaption>Fig.3 - Variant function using \(\leadsto\)</figcaption>
</figure>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variant function doesn't increase while
\(\neg Q\)
holds</h4>
\(
(P \wedge (f = K) \wedge \neg Q) \; \rightarrow \; (P \wedge (f \leq K)) \vee Q
\)
<p>
This formula says that if \(P \wedge \neg Q\) holds in a state where
the value of the variant function is \(K\) then in the next state
either (1) \(P \wedge \neg Q\) continues to hold with the same or lower
value of the variant function or (2) \(Q\) holds.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variant function cannot remain unchanged
while \(\neg Q\) holds</h4>
Let \(R \; \equiv \; (P \wedge (f = K) \wedge \neg Q)\). Then:
<p>
\(R \leadsto \neg R\)
<p>
This formula says that \(R\) does not hold forever. 
<p>
The variant function theorem
follows from the two parts.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Summary of Proof Rules for \(\leadsto\)</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<ol>
  <li>
  To prove \(P \leadsto \neg P\), identify an action \(a\) which is
  executed infinitely often and for which the following Hoare triple
  holds: \(\{P\} \; a \; \{\neg P\}\).
  </li>
  <li>
  Transitivity: If \(P \leadsto Q\) and \(Q \leadsto R\) then
  <br>
  \(P \leadsto R\)
  </li>
  <li>
  Disjunction: If \(P \leadsto Q\) and \(P' \leadsto Q\) then
  <br>
  \((P \vee P') \leadsto Q\)
  </li>
  <li>
  Basic Property: If \([\forall a: \; \{P\} \; a \; \{P \vee Q\}]\)
  and
  \(P \leadsto \neg P\) then
  <br>
  \(P \leadsto Q\)
  </li>
</ol>
The use of the variant function uses all of these proof rules.
  
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Eventually and CTL</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
We define an operator <i>Eventually</i> or \(E\) on predicates as
follows:
For a predicate \(Q\),
\(E(Q)\) holds for a state \(s\) exactly when for every trajectory that
starts in \(s\):
\(Q\) holds in \(s\) or at a future point in
the trajectory.
<p>

So \(E(Q)\) is the weakest predicate \(P\) such that \(P \leadsto
Q\). Therefore
<p>
\(
E(Q) \leadsto Q
\)
<p>
and
<p>
\(
(P \leadsto Q) \; \equiv \; [P \; \Rightarrow \; E(Q)]
\)
<p>

The definition of <i>Eventually</i> in terms of CTL is
\(E = AF\)
where \(A\) stands for <i>all</i> trajectories from a state and \(F\) stands for a
<i>future</i> point in the trajectory.
