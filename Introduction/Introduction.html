    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h2>
    <p>
    Concurrent systems consist of multiple interacting agents.
    These systems impact almost everything you do from using social
    media, credit cards, phones, and cryptocurrencies, playing
    multiplayer games, and flying or driving.

    <p>
    Many of these systems run forever,
    unlike programs that read input, produce output, and
    halt.
    Because they run forever, they must deal with component failures.
    Errors in these systems have
    catastrophic consequences, but testing them to ensure safety is
    notoriously difficult because of nondeterministic interaction
    among agents.

    <p>
    Discussing the different types of concurrent systems takes more
    time than we have.
    So in this course we restrict attention to:
    <ol>
      <li>
      <i>fundamentals</i>,
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>distributed</i> systems, i.e. message-passing systems,
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>correctness</i>: 
      proving that algorithms are correct,
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>resilience</i>: systems that function despite unreliable components.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The key concepts of the course are states, nondeterminism and
    interleaving of atomic actions, the role of timelines and time,
    and the use of temporal logic.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">State</h4>
    The future behavior of a system, given its state, is independent
    of its past. The concept of state is fundamental to all
    systems. You have used it in economics, control systems, 
    stochastic processes, and in programming.
    <p>
    A state of a distributed system consists of the states of its
    component agents and component communication links. We sometimes
    emphasize the distinction between the <i>global</i> state of the
    entire system and the local state of a component. The state of a
    system changes when the staet of any component changes.
<p>
The trajectory of a system is a sequence of states over time. We use
    the terms system trajectory, program computation, and paths of
    state-transition systems interchangeably. For example, the state of a program
    is given by the values of its variables and the computation of a
    program is specified by the sequence of its states.

    <p>
    The systems that we discuss in those course have discrete
    states. We also discuss a few systems with continuous state spaces.
We represent systems by states and their transitions, and the focus of
    this course is
on an abstraction: <i>A state-transition system.</i>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Interleaving Atomic Actions</h4>
An agent executes atomic actions. The execution of an atomic action
causes a  transition from one state to another: there are no
intermediate states during the transition.

<p>
What happens if multiple agents execute atomic actions simultaneously? We
represent simultaneity by choosing an arbitrary order of
atomic actions. Suppose two agents request exclusive access to a
file at exactly the same time; we represent this situation by having
one of the agents make the request first, followed by the other. This
interleaving of actions allows us to treat a trajectory as a
sequence of state transitions caused by a sequence of actions.

<p>
The interleaving of actions is inherently nondeterministic. Many
agents may be ready to execute actions at an instant, and we want to
allow any of them to proceed next. Most 
courses in sequential programming deal with deterministic systems: If
you run the same program multiple times with the same input then you
get the same behavior each time. In contrast, if a distributed system is executed
multiple times it may produce different behaviors in different
runs. That's why debugging deterministic
sequential programs is easier than debugging distributed systems.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Progress, Fairness, Temporal Logic</h4>
Consider a system in which agents \(x\) and \(y\) send messages back
and forth between the two of them. An agent \(z\) sends a "stop"
message to both \(x\) and \(y\). When \(x\) or \(y\) receive a "stop"
message they stop sending messages. What behaviors do we expect from
this system?
<p>
The trajectory unfolds by picking one atomic action that an agent can
perform. So, a trajectory could consist of \(x\) and \(y\) sending
messages to each other infinitely often, while the "stop" message
remains in flight forever. We expect, however, that message delivery
will be fair. A system that delivers messages from \(x\) and \(y\),
but not \(z\) is unfair. We may not know when a message
will be delivered, but we do expect a message that is sent to be delivered at some
time. We capture this concept using a
<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic">temporal
logic.</a>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines, Time, Snapshots, Knowledge</h4>
Timeline diagrams show each agent's states and actions at different
points in time.
Timelines are used in many disciplines,
such as history, where objects change.
In some cases the time in a timeline is real time, or physical
time. In other cases, this time is "logical time" --- a concept that
we use in lieu of real time.
Timelines are a commonplace simple idea; however, they can be very
useful in understanding how the states of different agents change as a
trajectory unfolds.

<p>
In an informal discussion of a distributed algorithm we may talk about
what an agent "knows." Endowing agents with the capability of human
reasoning can be helpful while brainstorming algorithms; however,
doing so can be dangerous because we may expect more from our agents
than they deliver. We will define concepts such as "what an agent
<i>knows</i>" and how an agent gains and loses knowledge with time.

<p>
A critical question for most distributed algorithms is: What does one
agent know about the state of another agent? More generally, what does
an agent know about the state of the entire system? This is related to
the idea of global snapshots. And snapshots, in turn, are related to
timelines. In this course we will spend time on using the idea of
timelines to understand distributed systems, how agents' knowledge
changes, and how an agent can take snapshots of others.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Resilience to Failure</h4>
A component can fail in different ways. A message channel may break
and messages may no longer be delivered along the channel. An agent
may send unexpected messages and an agent may pretend to be another
agent. We will look at some important failure modes in this course and
discuss resilient algorithms that deal with failures.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h4>
Concurrent systems are ubiquitous; they impact many of the things that
you do.
<p>
This course focuses on fundamentals, message-passing systems,
correctness of systems, and resilience to failure.
<p>
Key ideas that run through this course are states; nondeterminism and
interleaving of atomic actions; fairness of actions and proving
progress using temporal logic; the role of timelines in understanding
what agents know and how they can take snapshots of states of other
systems; and different failure modes and algorithms that are resilient
to them.
