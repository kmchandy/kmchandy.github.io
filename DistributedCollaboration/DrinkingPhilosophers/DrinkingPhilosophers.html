<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Resource Management: Drinking
Philosophers</h1>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module describes algorithms for "The Distributed Drinking
Philosophers Problem," by which distributed agents share indivisible
resources, such as exclusive access to files. 
</h4>


    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
      This module describes algorithms by which distributed agents
      share indivisible resources, such as exclusive access to files,
      in a fair way. 
      </li>
      <li>
      The module shows how to use a <i>total</i> ordering of
    priorities to share resources fairly. The dining philosophers
      algorithm, given in an earlier module, uses a partial ordering.
      </li>
      <li>
      We show how time --- readings from local clocks of agents --- is
      used to obtain priorities that are totally ordered.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   The description of the algorithm in this module is not as detailed
    as that given for dining philosophers. You can define a formal
    specification and carry out a detailed proof for this algorithm in
    almost exactly the same was as for dining philosophers.

    
   
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h2>
    A set of agents shares a set of indivisible resources. Exclusive
    access to a file is an example of an indivisible resource.

    <p>
    The
    lifecycle of an agent is the same as in Dining Philosophers: (1)
    executing outside the critical section, (2) waiting to enter a
    critical section, and (3) executing in the critical section. The
    problem is identical to Dining Philosophers except for the
    transition to the critical section.

    <p>
    An  agent executes outside the critical section without
    holding any resources. An agent may execute outside critical
    sections for ever, or it may start waiting to enter a critical section.
    When an agent starts waiting
    to enter a critical section it waits to get exclusive access to a
    nonempty subset of the resources. It continues waiting until it
    gets all the resources for which it waits. While it waits it does
    not change the subset of resources for which it waits.
    The agent continues to hold these resources when it executes in
    the critical section. An agent remains in a critical section for
    only a finite number of steps and then starts executing outside
    the critical section at which point it no longer needs resources.

    <p>
    For example, an agent needs exclusive access to a set of files for
    it to execute in its next critical section, and it waits until it
    is given this access. While it is in the critical section it
    continues to have exclusive access to these files. When it is
    executing outside the critical section it does not need access to
    these files. Each time an agent starts to wait it may wait for a
different set of files.



    <figure>
    <img src="Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Agent Lifecycle</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>
    The ideas in this module can be used to manage agents that require
    read or write access to files. Multiple agents can have read
    access to a file concurrently. While an agent has write access to
    a file no other agent can have access to the file. A homework
    problem deals with read/write access.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Drinking Philosophers</p>
The drinking philosophers name is another example of an attempt at
CS humor. A philosopher is in one of three states: <i>tranquil</i>,
<i>thirsty</i> or <i>drinking</i>. A philosopher may remain tranquil
for ever, or it may become thirsty for one or more beverages. It
remains thirsty until it gets all the beverages for which it
waits. Only when a thirsty philosopher gets all the beverages for
which it waits does it start drinking. It continues to drinking all these
beverages until it becomes tranquil again. Philosophers drink for only
finite time.

<p>
A philosopher that enters the tranquil state remains in that state for
at least a constant \(\gamma\) amount of time. So, a philosopher can't
go from drinking to thirsty instantaneously or in an arbitrarily small
amount of time.


    <figure>
    <img src="Slide2.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Drinking Philosophers</figcaption>
</figure>

    

<p>
A beverage can be held by at most one philosopher. Imagine there's
only one bottle of each beverage in the system, and philosophers send
bottles to each other. One philosopher can drink vodka and cola
while another philosopher drinks gin and tonic. However, one agent cannot drink
vodka and cola while another drinks vodka and orange juice.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm</h3>
There are many algorithms for this problem; here we discuss one.
Each beverage is an indivisible unique token. A token is
exchanged between agents and a <i>manager</i> of the token. We assume
that each token has its own manager --- this assumption is merely for
convenience of exposition.

<p  class="w3-text-teal">Messages</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>request</i>: An agent sends a request for a beverage to a
  manager. A request is a pair \(agent\_id, request\_priority\), the
  id of the requestor and the priority of the request.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>beverage</i>: A manager sends a beverage to a requesting agent, and agents
  send beverages back to managers. A beverage is uniquely identified
  by its name.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>demand</i>: A manager sends a demand to an agent for the
  beverage that the manager manages and that the agent holds. 
  </li>
</ol>

  <p  class="w3-text-teal">Agent Actions</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
    When an agent becomes thirsty it sends requests to managers for
    all the beverages that it needs to drink.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a thirsty agent gets a demand to return a beverage to a manager
    then the agent returns the beverage and sends another request for
  the beverage. The priority of this new request is the same as the
  priority of this agent's last request.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a thirsty agent gets all the beverages that it needs to drink
    then it starts drinking.
    </li>
    <li>
    When an agent finishes drinking it returns all the beverages that
    it holds to the managers of the beverages.
    </li>
  </ol>


  <p  class="w3-text-teal">Manager Actions</p>
  A manager has local variable \((hr, hp)\),  which is the id of the agent to which the
  manager has most recently sent 
  the beverage, and the priority of the request made by that
  agent. \(hr\) is an acronym for <i>h</i>andling <i>r</i>equestor,
  and \(hp\) is an acronym for <i>h</i>andling <i>p</i>riority.
  If the manager holds the beverage then this variable is empty (\(Null\)). 
  <p>
  A manager also maintains a priority queue of pending requests ordered by
  priority.

  <p>The actions of a manager are as follows.
  
  <ol>
    <li>
    If a manager gets a request \((r, p)\) while it holds a beverage then it
    sends the beverage to the requestor \(r\), and sets
    \(hr, hp  = r, p\).
    </li>
    <li>
    If a manager gets a request \((r, p)\) while it does not hold the
    beverage and \(hp > p\) then the manager inserts the request \((r,
    p)\) into the priority queue of pending requests.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a manager gets a request \((r, p)\) while it does not hold the
    beverage and \(hp < p\) then:
    <ol>
      <li>the manager sends a demand to \(hr\) to return the
      beverage, if the manager has not already sent that demand, and
      </li>
      <li> the manager inserts the request \((r, p)\) into its priority queue of
      pending requests.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    If a manager gets a beverage and it has no pending requests then
    the manager holds the beverage and sets the handling requestor and
    priority to empty.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a manager gets a beverage and it has pending requests then
    let \((r, p)\) be the request at the head of the priority queue
    (i.e. the request with the highest priority). It sends the
    beverage to requestor \(r\),
    removes \((r, p)\) from the queue of pending requests,
    and sets
     \(hr, hp  = r, p\).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 style="color:red;">Example</h2>
  The example shows a scenario. The system has two agents, Maya and
  Liu both of whom are tranquil in the initial state. There are three beverages: Tea,
  coffee and milk. Initially, these beverages are with their managers.
  <p>
  The next diagram, stage 1, shows the state after Maya gets thirsty for tea and milk.
  So she sends requests to the managers of tea and milk. The priority
  of this request is 2. (We will discuss how priorities are obtained
  later.)
  
    <figure>
    <img src="Slide3.jpg" alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Stage 1</figcaption>
  </figure>

  The next diagram, stage 2, shows the situation after the managers of tea and
  milk get requests from Maya, and respond by sending the beverages to
  Maya because there are no pending requests for these beverages. The
  beverages, tea and milk, are in the channel to Maya.
  <figure>
    <img src="Slide4.jpg" alt="Fig4" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Stage 2</figcaption>
  </figure>

  The stage 3 diagram shows a state after Liu becomes thirsty for
  coffee and milk. So she sends requests for coffee and milk to the
  managers of these beverages. The priority of the request is 5.
  <p>
  Maya has received the milk beverage but tea is still in the
  channel. So, Maya remains thirsty.
  <figure>
    <img src="Slide5.jpg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Stage 3</figcaption>
  </figure>

  The stage 4 diagram shows a state in which the coffee manager
  receives Liu's request and sends
  coffee to Liu because there are no pending requests for coffee. When
  the milk manager gets Liu's request, the manager puts the request on
  the priority queue of pending requests. At this point the queue has
  only Liu's request.

  The
  milk manager demands milk back from Maya because her request has
  priority 2 whereas Liu's request has priority 5. Maya is still
  thirsty because the tea hasn't arrived yet.
  <figure>
    <img src="Slide6.jpg" alt="Fig6" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Stage 4</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Next, Maya receives the demand for milk and responds by sending the
  milk back to the milk manager. Maya also resends its original
request for milk, with priority 2, to the milk manager.
Then Maya receives tea. Maya
  continues to be thirsty because she has only one of the two
  beverages that she needs to drink. Liu has coffee, but she remains
  thirsty because milk is in the channel from Maya to the milk manager.
  <figure>
    <img src="Slide7.jpg" alt="Fig7" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.7: Stage 5</figcaption>
</figure>

In stage 6, the milk manager has received Maya's request for milk with
  priority 2 and received milk. So, the milk manager sends the milk to
  respond to the highest priority request in the priority queue; this
  request is from Liu. The milk manager puts Maya's request into the
  queue of pending requests.
  <figure>
    <img src="Slide8.jpg" alt="Fig8" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.8: Stage 6</figcaption>
</figure>

In stage 7, Liu has received both milk and coffee, and so she is
drinking. Maya is still thirsty, holding tea, while Maya's request for
milk is in the queue of pending requests for milk.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">How Priorities Change</h2>
If priorities don't change then the agents with high priorities
may continue to go rapidly through the tranquil, thirsty, drinking
cycle while other agents remain thirsty for ever.

<p>
One way to assign priorities is as follows.
Associated with each request is a timestamp which is 
the time read from the requestor's local clock at the instant at which
the request is made. A request's timestamp does not change after the
request is created.
<p>
A request's priority is a pair (timestamp,
requestor's id), with priorities compared lexicographically, and lower
values having higher priority. So, requests made earlier have higher
priority than requests made later. The requestor's id is used to break
ties.
<p>
What are the requirement's of agents' local
clocks that ensure that all thirsty philosophers drink eventually?

<p class="w3-text-teal">A Minimum Requirement on Clocks</p>
<i>An agent's clock must tick forward</i> between successive requests
by the agent. If the agent's clock remained stuck at the same
value for ever then the agent using that clock may get the highest
priority for ever, and go through tranquil, thirsty, drinking cycles
infinitely which makes other agents remain tranquil for ever.

<p>
Assume that each clock reading is an integer: for example, the number of
picoseconds since January 1, 1900. (NTP units are \(2^{-32}\) of a
second.) The clock ticks forward
between successive requests by the same philosopher because the
philosopher remains in tranquil state for at least \(\gamma\) units of
time where \(\gamma\) is a positive constant. Treat each agent's clock
tick as an event.

<p>
Local clocks of agents may drift apart, but let's assume that the
magnitude of the difference between clock readings of different agents
is bounded.

<p>
Even if the
philosopher makes a new request when its clock ticks forward by one
unit, eventually the timestamp of a request from that philosopher will
exceed \(T\) for any value of \(T\). This ensures that while a
philosopher is thirsty, another philosopher cannot overtake it for
ever.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h4>
The proof of safety --- multiple philosophers don't hold the same
beverage at the same time --- is straightforward. It follows
because a token is at exactly one agent or in exactly one channel.

<p>
Let's prove that a thirsty philosopher \(v\) with a request with timestamp
\(T\) drinks eventually. Let \(t[i]\) be the reading of philosopher
\(i\)'s clock.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Each agent's clock reading eventually exceeds \(T\)</p>

We observe that each agent's clock ticks forward:
<p>
\(
\forall i, \tau: (t[i] = \tau) \leadsto (t[i] \geq \tau + 1)
\)
<p>
Therefore, each \(i\)'s clock eventually reads a
value greater than \(T\), using transitivity of \(\leadsto\).
<p>
\(
\forall i, \tau: (t[i] = \tau) \leadsto (t[i] > T)
\)
<p>
From the previous formula, and taking disjunction over all values of
\(\tau\): 
<p>
\(
\forall i:  \quad true \leadsto (t[i] > T)
\)
<p>
Because clock readings never go back in time, \(t[i] > T\) is stable,
and therefore:
<p>
\(
\forall i:  \quad true \leadsto always(t[i] > T)
\)
<p>
Let \(Q\) be the predicate that all clocks read values that
exceed \(T\):
<p>
\(Q = \forall i: t[i] > T\).
<p>
From the above formula and because \(X \leadsto always(Y)\) and \(X
\leadsto always(Y')\) allows us to deduce \(X \leadsto always(Y \vee Y')\)
<p>
\(
 true \leadsto always(Q)
\)

<p class="w3-text-teal">The number of pending requests with timestamps
less than \(T\) decreases</p>

<p>
From the above formula:
<p>
\(
v.thirsty \; \leadsto \; (v.drinking \wedge Q) \vee (v.thirsty \wedge Q)
\)
<p>
Next we will prove that if \(v\) is thirsty and all clocks read values
that exceed \(T\), then \(v\) will drink eventually:
<p>
\(
 (v.thirsty \wedge Q) \leadsto v.drinking
\)
<p>
Let \(req\) be the number of pending requests with timestamps less than
\(T\). We will prove 
<p>
\(
(v.thirsty \wedge Q \wedge (req = k) \; \leadsto \;
v.drinking \vee (v.thirsty \wedge Q \wedge (req < k))
\)
<p>
This proof is straightforward: The request with the lowest timestamp
gets all the resources it needs.
<p>
\(
(v.thirsty \wedge Q \wedge (req = 0) \; \leadsto \;
v.drinking 
\)
<p>
The result follows using the rules
for variant functions.

<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  In the algorithm, each manager of a resource maintains a
  <i>priority</i> queue of requests for the resource. Is the algorithm
  correct if managers maintain first-come-first-served queues rather
  than priority queues?
  </li>
  <li>
  Show that the proposed variant function is correct: show that it
  does not increase while an agent remains thirsty, and show that it
  decreases eventually.
  </li>
</ol>
