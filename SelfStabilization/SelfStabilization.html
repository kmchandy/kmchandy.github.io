<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Self Stabilization</h1>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module describes one example of a self-stabilization system --- a
system that recovers automatically from transient errors.
</h4>

    A <i>self stabilizing</i> system
    recovers automatically from transient errors.
    If a self-stabilizing system enters an unsafe state then the
    system will correct itself and eventually enter a safe state.

    <p>
    The literature on self stabilization is extensive. Let's look at
    one example of a self-stabilizing system to get an idea of its
    design.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Self Stabilizing Token Passing</h3>
    A ring of agents passes a single token around the ring. An
    agent that holds the token knows that no other agent has the token
    at that point. So, the system can be used to implement mutual
    exclusion.

    <p>
    Examples of errors are the disappearance of the single token and
    the creation of additional tokens. A self stabilizing algorithm
    ensures that eventually the system gets back to a safe state,
    i.e., one in which it has exactly one token.

    <p>
    Let's begin with a model in which each agent in the ring can read
    the state of its predecessor in the ring. Later, we will modify the
    algorithm to work with message-passing.


    <p>
    \(N\) agents, indexed \(j\), are organized in a ring where agent
    \((j+1) \: \textrm{mod} \: N\) can read the state of agent
    \(j\). Hereafter, we will not write "\(\textrm{mod} \; N\);" it is
    to be understood.

    <p>
    An agent is either <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. The system is
    required to have exactly one active process. The active process
    can be thought of as having the single token in the system.  The
    token is passed from agent \(j\) to agent \(j+1\) when agent \(j\)
    becomes idle and agent \(j+1\) becomes active.

    <p>
    For convenience in visualizing diagrams, let's assume that the
    state of an agent is a color. Next we describe the basic algorithm
    that assumes that errors do not occur; later we will modify the
    algorithm to obtain a self-stabilizing algorithm that recover from
    errors.


<p class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</p>
    The algorithm for agent \(0\) is different from that of
    the other agents. Agent \(0\) has the token exactly when its color
    is <i>the same</i> as that of its predecessor. Any other agent holds
    the token exactly when its color is <i>different</i> from that of its
predecessor.

<p>
An agent \(j\) passes the token to
agent \(j+1\) when agent \(j\) changes its color.
Agent \(0\) has the token when all the agents
in the ring have the same color.

<p>
The diagram below illustrates an example with 4 agents where an
agent's color is either red or blue.
The diagram shows how the token is passed from
each agent to its sucessor.
<p>

<p>
In the figure on the top left, all the agents are red; so agent 0 has
the token. When agent 0 changes its color we get the diagram at the
top center. In this diagram, agent 0 is blue and all the other agents
are red. Agent 0 no longer has the token because its color is
different from that of its predecessor; however agent 1 does have the token
because its color is different from that of its predecessor. The
sequence of diagrams shows what happens when the agent holding the
token --- which is the only active agent --- changes its color.

<figure>
    <img src="Slide01.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: The token is passed by an agent changing color</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Faults</h4>
Let's look at the state of a system after a fault occurs.  The next
set of diagrams shows how errors --- once they occur --- can propagate
for ever.  These diagrams show a system with three tokens whereas an
error-free system should have exactly one.  The three agents holding
tokens are shown with large yellow numbers and the agent that does not
hold a token is shown with a smaller black number.

<figure>
    <img src="Slide02.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Errors can propagate forever</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The figure on the top left of the above diagram shows agents 1, 2 and
3 with tokens because their colors are different from those of their
predecessors. The next diagram, top right, shows agents 1 and 3 with
tokens because their colors are different from those of their
predecessors, and agent 0 with a token because its color is the same
as that of its predecessor. The transition to the diagram on the top
right from the one on the top left occurs when agent 3 changes its
color. 

<p>
The sequence of state transitions gets the system to the figure on the
bottom left which is the same as that on the top left with the colors
reversed. This cycle of state transitions can repeat forever, with the
same system always having three tokens. So, this system is not self
stabilizing.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">A Self-Stabilizing Algorithm</h2>
<i>The solution: add more colors!</i>

<p>
We will modify the design to have as many colors as there are
agents. In our example, we will have 4 colors because it has 4
agents. The algorithms for all agents, other than agent 0, remains
unchanged. As before agent 0 has the
token when its color is the same as that of its predecessor and agent 0
sends the token by changing agent 0's color. The difference in the
self-stabilizing algorithm is the color to which agent 0 transits.


<p>
Assume that the 4 colors are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3. If agent 0's color
is \(k\) it makes a transition by changing its color to \(k \:
\textrm{mod} \: N\).

<p>
The diagram below gives an example of how agent 0's color changes. Its
sequence of colors, 0, 1, 2, 3 are red, blue, green, yellow,
respectively. The diagram on the top left shows a configuration in
which agent 0 holds a token because its color (green --- number 2) is
the same as that of its predecessor. Agent 0 passes the token by
changing its color to 3 (yellow), as show on the diagram on the top
right.

<p>
The diagram in the middle left shows agent 0 with a token. It passes
the token by changing its color from 1 (blue) to 2 (green), as shown
in the diagram in the middle right.



<figure>
    <img src="Slide03.jpg" alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Changes in color of agent 0</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h3>
The proof has the following three ideas that we first describe
informally.
<ol>
  <li>
  In all states at least one agent holds a token.
  </li>
  <li>
  All trajectories from all states lead to a state in which agent 0
  holds a token.
  </li>
  <li>
  A trajectory from a system state in which agent 0's color is
  different from that of the other agents leads to a state in which
  all agents have the same color (in 
  which case the system is in a safe state). 
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 1</p>
If all agents have the same color then agent 0 holds a token.
If there is more than one color in the ring then there is at least one
agent, other than agent 0, whose color is different from that of its
predecessor's; so, that agent holds a token.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 2</p>
Agent 0 and agent \(n-1\) will
get the same color at some point because 
agent 0's color will propagate all the way around the ring unless it
gets to agent \(n-1\) sooner.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 3</p>
If agent 0's color is different from the colors of agents \(1, \ldots,
n-1\) then the only
trajectory that leads to agents 0 and agent \(n-1\) having the same
color is for agent 0's color to propagate all the way around the ring.

<p class="w3-text-teal">The system always reaches a safe state</p>
Let \(S\) be any state. Let the \(C\) be the set of agent colors in state
\(S\). If \(C\) has all \(N\) colors, then the color of agent \(0\) is
different from the colors of the other agents, and so the result
follows from part 3.

<p>
If \(C\) has fewer than \(N\) colors then the color of each agent
remains a color in \(C\) until agent 0 gets a color that is not in
\(C\). At this point agent 0's color is different from that of the
other agents and the result follows.

<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  In this algorithm, does any agent detect that the system is in an
  unsafe state? Can we determine that the system is in an unsafe state
  based solely on the state of any one agent and the state of its
  predecessor? Why?
  </li>
  <li>
  Will this algorithm work if the number of colors is arbitrarily
  large, and more than the number of agents? Why?
  </li>
  <li>
  Will this algorithm work if the number of colors is less than the
  number of agents? Why?
  </li>
</ol>
