    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Self Test: Flight Formation</h1>

    
    <p>
    This self test is to prove a concurrent system in
    which a collection of agents in space, move towards a formation,
    even though each agent can only communicate with its neighbors.

    
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h4>
<p>
    Agents \(0\) and \(N\) are called anchors. The anchors are
    stationary while the other agents move so as to create a specified
    formation. 
    
    For \(0 < j < N\), agent \(j\)'s neighbors are agents \(j-1\) and
    \(j+1\).

    <p>
    Let agent \(j\)'s location be \(l[j]\), and let its initial value
    be \(l[j]^{0}\).
    When the computation terminates, the anchors must be at their
    initial positions, and the locations of other agents must be 
    \(\epsilon\)-close to the midpoint of the locations of its
    neighbors.
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      Anchors are stationary.
      <p>
    \(
    (l[0] = l[0]^{0}) \wedge (l[N] = l[N]^{0})
      \)
      </li>
      <li>
      Other agents are approximately at midpoints of their
    neighbors.
      \(
      \forall 0 < j < N :
      \)
      \(
      \quad
      |l[j] - mid | < \epsilon
      \)
      <p>
      where \(mid = (l[j-1]+ l[j+1])/2 \)
      </li>
   </ol>
   
<p>
The figure below shows the desired terminal state.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Agent Actions</h3>
    
    <p>
    Agents \(0\) and \(N\) are stationary.
    The action of agent \(j\) for \(0 < j < N\) is as follows.
    If the distance from the agent's location to the midpoint
    of its neighbors is more than or equal to \(\epsilon\) then the
    agent moves to  the midpoint; otherwise, the agent
    does nothing. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The action is specified by the following program
    segment. Let \(l\) be the vector of agents' locations where
    \(l[j]\) is the location of the \(j\)-th agent.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
    mid = (l[j-1] + l[j+1])/2.0
    if |l[j] - mid| >= epsilon:
         l[j] = mid
    </pre>

    <p>
    The program segment is equivalent to the guarded command:
    <p>
    \(
    |l[j] - mid| \geq \epsilon \quad \rightarrow \quad l[j] = mid
    \)

    <p>
    The figure below shows an example with agents indexed 0 through
    5. The figure shows the movement of agent 1 to the midpoint of
    agents 0 and 2. The figure also shows the movement of agent 4 to the midpoint of
    agents 3 and 5. All the agents can move simultaneously; however,
    for simplicity we will assume that only one agent moves at a time.

   <p>
    The next figure shows 3 diagrams from top to bottom. The diagram
    at the top is the state at some point. The diagram in the middle
    shows the state after agent 1 (red) moves to the midpoint of
    agents 0 and 2. The diagram at the bottom shows the state after
    agent 3 moves to the midpoint of agents 2 and 4. Note that the
    agents seem to be moving away from the goal of having all agents
    on the line connecting the stationary agents 0 and 5.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Self Test: Proof of Correctness</h2>
    
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Test 1</h5>
    Give and prove an invariant of the loop.
    
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Test 2</h5>
    Prove that the loop terminates by giving a variant function for
    the loop. 
    
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Test 3</h5>
Show that the specification holds upon termination of the loop.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answers</h3>
   
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 1</h5>
The invariant is: The anchors are stationary.

      <p>
    \(
    (l[0] = l[0]^{0}) \wedge (l[N] = l[N]^{0})
\)
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 2</h5>
<p>
A variant function \(f\) is the sum of the
    square of the lengths between neighboring agents.
    </p>
    <p>
\(
    f(l) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} ((x_{j} - x_{j-1})^{2} + (y_{j} - y_{j-1})^{2})
    \)
</p>
This variant function is bounded below.
You can show that the execution of any guarded command with a True
guard reduces the value of the variant function by at least a positive
constant \(\delta\).
So, variant function value can decrease for only a finite number of
    steps. 

<p>
We leave it to you to determine \(\delta\). The largest
value of \(\delta\) is immaterial; all you need to do is show that
there exists a positive value. (Hint: \(\delta\) depends on
\(\epsilon\) and the initial configuration.)
</p>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 3</h5>
<p>
We must show that if the invariant holds and all guards are false then
the specification is satisfied. This is trivial.

Design a similar algorithm in which agents move in 3-D space.
