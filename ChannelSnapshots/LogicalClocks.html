  A logical clock algorithm assigns a value, called the logical time,
  to each step in a computation so that every edge in the dataflow
  graph of the computation is from a vertex with a smaller logical
  time to a vertex at a higher logical time.
  So, all sequences of steps in ascending logical time are topological
  sorts of the dataflow graph, and therefore all sequences of steps in
  ascending logical time are computations.
  An epoch is similar to logical time where there exists a computation
  that is a sequence of steps in ascending epoch.
  We use epochs in Paxos, a consensus algorithm.

    <p>
  The standard definition is in terms of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_clock">
   causality</a> rather than data flow, but
  the definitions are equivalent with "step \(e\) causes step \(e'\)" as
  the same as "there is a path in the dataflow graph from \(e\) to \(e'\)."

  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: Logical Times of Steps</h5>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  Figure 1 shows the dataflow graph of a computation with agents
  \(A, B, C\) and step sequence \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, ]\).
  The white numbers inside the black vertices are the step ids which show the
  position of the step in the computation.
  The red numbers outside the steps are logical times assigned to
steps.
</p>

  <p>
  Logical times are arbitrary provided
every edge is directed from a lower to a higer logical time.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Logical Clock Algorithm</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
The following algorithm is suggested by the logical time property.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">Assigning Logical Times to Steps</h5>
<p style="color:blue;">
For any step \(e\) at any agent \(x\), let \(e'\) be the step immediately preceding \(e\)
at \(x\) and let the timestamp of the message received in \(e\) be
\(T\).
</p>
<center>
<p style="color:blue;">
Set \(t(e)\) to be any value greater than max(t(e'), T).
</p>
</center>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
This rule ensures that (1) later steps at an agent have higher logical
times than earlier steps at that agent, and (2) a message is received
in a step with a higher logical time than the logical time of the step
in which the message is sent.
<p>
    The correctness of the algorithm is self evident.

    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h5>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    All sequences of steps of a dataflow graph in ascending order of
    logical time are computations.
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
    <p>
    For any edge \((e, e')\) in the dataflow graph, \(t(e) < t(e')\).
    In a sequence of steps ascending in time, \(e\) appears before
    \(e'\), and so the sequence is a topological sort of the
    dataflow graph, and
    <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Model.html#TheoremTopologicalSort">
    therefore the sequence is a computation.</a>

    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Epochs</h3>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
      <p>
  Design an algorithm that assigns a value \(t(e)\), called the
    <i>epoch</i> of \(e\), to each step \(e\) in a computation so that:
  </p>
   
  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
  <h4 style="color:blue;">The Epoch Property</h4>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  For all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
</p>
    <hr class="new2">

    <p>
    The only difference between logical time and epochs is that
    strict inequality \(t(e) < t(e')\) in logical time has been
    replaced by non-strict inequality \(t(e) \leq t(e')\) in epochs.
    </p>

      <p>
    Epochs of steps are arbitrary provided every edge is directed from
    a step to a step with the same or higher epoch.

  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: Epochs of Steps</h5>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------->
    
    Figure 2 shows an assignment of epochs to steps for the dataflow
    graph that is also shown in figure 1.
    <p>
    The dataflow graph is for a computation C = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
    8] and the sequence of epochs for this computation is [0, 1, 2, 1,
    1, 1, 2, 3, 2], which is not in ascending order.
    An example of a permutation of the given computation, where the
    permutation is in ascending order, is C' = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 8, 7]
    and the sequence of epochs is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
    2, 2, 2, 3].
</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.021.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 2: Epochs of Steps</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
    The sequence of steps C' is obtained from C by switching the order
    of adjacent elements that are not in order.  For example, step 2
    has a higher epoch than step 3, but step 2 appears before, and
    adjacent to, step 3 in C.  Steps 2 and 3 are independent -- there is no
    path between them in the dataflow graph -- and so switching them
    gives a sequence of steps which is a computation.  Repeatedly
    switching the order of adjacent elements that are not in order
    gives C'.
</p>

<p>
Observe that for each agent the sequence of steps at the agent is the
same in C and C'. For example, the sequence of steps of agent A in
both C and C' is [0, 1, 3, 5], and the sequence of steps of agent B in
both C and C' is [0, 4, 7].

    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Rules for Epochs</h4>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    
    <p>
    Epochs are assignments \(t(e)\) to step \(e\) such that for
    all steps \(e, e'\): 
    <ol>
      <li>
      If \(e\) and \(e'\) occur at the same agent and \(e'\) occurs
      after \(e\) then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
      </li>
      <li>
      If \(e\) is a step in which a message is sent and \(e'\) is the
      step in which that message is received then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
      </li>
    </ol>

  <div id="SECTION", class="EpochTheorem">
    <a name="EpochTheorem"></a>
       <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h5>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    Let \(C\) be a computation and let \(t(e)\) be the epoch of step
    \(e\) for each step \(e\) in the computation.  There exists a
    computation \(C'\) where: (1) For each
    agent \(v\) the sequence of steps at \(v\) is the same in \(C\)
    and \(C'\), and (2) steps in \(C'\) are in ascending order of epochs.

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
    Let \(G\) be the dataflow graph of \(C\).
    We will identify a topological sort \(C'\) of \(G\) where
    \(C'\) satisfies the condition of the theorem.
    Because all topological sorts of the dataflow graph are
    computations it follows that \(C'\) is a computation.

    <p>
    Let \(C'\) be a permutation of \(C\) where steps in \(C'\) occur in ascending epochs
    and where steps with the same epoch occur in the same order in
    \(C\) and \(C'\).
    Computation \(C'\) can be obtained from \(C\) by repeatedly switching the
    order of adjacent steps in \(C\) that are not in order.
    
    <p>
    Let \((e, e')\) be an edge of the dataflow graph of \(C\).
    Then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
    If \(t(e) < t(e')\) then \(e\) is before \(e'\) in \(C'\) because
    events in \(C'\) are in ascending epochs.
    If \(t(e) = t(e')\) then  \(e\) is before \(e'\) in \(C\), and
    therefore \(e\) is before \(e'\) in \(C'\) because the order of
    steps with the same epoch are identical in \(C\) and \(C'\).
    So, \(C'\) is a topological sort of \(G\).

    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Applications of Logical Time and Epochs</h5>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->

    Sequences of steps in increasing logical time are computations.
    Logical times simplifies the development of algorithms because we
    can use this fact.
    We will see how a global snapshot algorithm uses this result.

    <p>
    There exists a sequence of steps in ascending epochs where the
sequence is a computation.
So there is a computation in which all steps with epoch \(t\) occur
    after all steps with epoch less than \(t\) and before all steps
with epoch greater than \(t\).
This fact simplifies the design of algorithms because we can work with
    a computation that executes steps sequentially in ascending order
of epoch.
We will see how we use the idea of increasing order of epochs in the
    consensus algorithm, Paxos.
