  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Local Clocks and Logical Time</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A logical clock algorithm assigns a value, called the logical time,
  to each event in a computation so that all sequences of events in
  ascending logical time are computations.

  </p>

   
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  Design an algorithm that assigns a value,  called the <i>logical
  time</i>, to each event in a computation so that all sequences of
  events in ascending logical time are computations.


   
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <p>

  A
  <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
  computation</a> is a sequence of events in which for all edges
  \((e, e')\) in the dataflow graph:
  <center>\(e\) occurs before \(e'\) in the
  sequence.
  </center>

  <p>
  So, the algorithm assigns logical time \(t(e)\) to event \(e\) such that:

  

  
  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
  <h4 style="color:blue;">The Logical Time Property</h4>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  For all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) < t(e')\).
</p>
<hr class="new2">



  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: Logical Times of Events</h5>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  
  Figure 1 shows the dataflow graph of a computation with agents
  \(A, B, C\) and an event sequence \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, ]\).

  The numbers inside the vertices are the event ids which show the
  position of the event in the computation.

  The red numbers outside the events are logical times assigned to
  events.

  <p>
  Logical times are arbitrary provided
  every edge is directed from a lower to a higer logical time.
  <figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 1: Logical Times of Events: Edges Directed from
  Lower to Higher Logical Times</figcaption>
  </figure>

Verify that every edge in figure 1 is from an event with a lower
logical time to an event with a higher logical time.

<p>The sequence of events in increasing logical time is:
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and this sequence is a computation.
  

  
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Logical Clock Algorithm</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
The following algorithm is suggested by the logical time property.

Let \(t(e)\) be the logical time assigned to event \(e\).

A message sent in an event \(e\) is assigned a timestamp \(t(e)\).

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
Let \(e'\) be the event immediately preceding an event \(e\) at an
agent, and let the timestamp of the message received in \(e\) be
\(T\).
<p style="color:blue;">
Set \(t(e)\) to be any value greater than max(t(e'), T).
<hr class="new2">

<p>
The correctness of the algorithm is self evident.


  
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Past, Future and State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->


  <p>
  The <i>past at logical time \(t\)</i> is defined as the set of events  with logical
time at most \(t\).

So, the <i>future at logical \(t\)</i> is the set of events  with logical
time greater than \(t\).


  <p>
  The state of an agent at logical time \(t\) is the label of the
  agent edge from the past to the future. 

The state of a channel at logical time \(t\) is the sequence of messages sent along the
channel in the past and received in the future. 


<!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 style="color:red;">Example: State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->
Figure 2 illustrates the state at logical time 6.5 of the
computation shown in figure 1.

  The curved purple line represents the slice.

  The slice separates the past of the slice from its future.

  Past events are colored black while future events are colored
green.

The states of agents and channels at logical time \(t = 6.5\) are
given by the labels of the edges that cut the purple line.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.002.jpeg"
alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
<figcaption>Fig. 2: Slice at Logical Time 6.5. Past is Set of Events
    with Logical Time at most 6.5</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The point at which the purple line cuts the timeline for agent \(A\)
can be thought of as the point in \(A\)'s computation at which the
logical time is exactly 6.5.

This cut is on the edge from the event at \(A\) with
  logical time at most 6.5 to the event with logical time greater
  than 6.5.

  In this example the cut is on the edge from event 3 to event 5.

  <p>
  The message edge from event 3 to event 7 represents a message sent
  along the channel from \(A\) to \(B\) in the past that is received
  in the future.

In this example, the state of the channel \((A, B)\) is the sequence
consisting of a 
single message which is the label of this edge.




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
Global snapshot algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\)
</h4>

An algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\) follows
directly from the definition of the state at logical time \(t\).

<ol>
  <li>
Each agent takes its local snapshot -- i.e. records its state -- after
an event with logical time at most \(t\) and before an
  event with logical time greater than \(t\).
  </li>
  <li>
An agent records the state of an input channel as the sequence of
messages with timestamps atmost \(t\) that the agent
  receives when its logical clock exceeds \(t\).
  </li>
</ol>

The purple line in figure 2 represents the global snapshot at logical
time 6.5.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Using Imperfect Clocks in Distributed Algorithms</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Intuition</p>
  We will design some algorithms using 
logical time to play the role of real time.
Figure 3 shows the computation in figure 2 with the horizontal axis
representing real time.
The position of an event with logical time \(t\) is at a distance of
\(t\) units from the origin.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.003.jpeg"
  alt="Fig3" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 3: Computation with Logical Time as Real Time</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Thinks of logical time as continuous, just as real time is continuous.
In this example, points at logical time \(6.5\) and \(6.6\) at agent
\(A\) refer to the same edge; however, it helps intuition to think
of the point at logical time \(6.6\) as a location to the right of the
point at logical time \(6.5\) on the same edge.

<p>
The slice at logical time \(6.5\) is represented by the vertical line
at time \(6.5\).
The left of the line is the past, and the right side of the line is
the future at that time.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Physical and Logical Clocks</p>
<p>
Operating systems maintain clocks. Some have atomic clocks or other
  high-fidelity clocks that use Precision or 
Network Time Protocols (PTP, NTP).
With high-fidelity clocks, it is unlikely -- though not impossible -- that a message sent when
the sender's clock is at \(t\) will be received when the receiver's
clock is \(t\) or earlier.
We will use OS clocks, but correct them using the logical clock
algorithm.
Such clocks have the following properties that we use in
designing many algorithms:

<ol>

  <li>

  Clocks tick forward forever: For all \(t\), there is a point in
  an infinite computation at which clocks of all agents exceed \(t\).
  </li>

  <li>

  Sequences of events in ascending order of time are computations.
  </li>
</ol>
