  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Local Clocks and Logical Time</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A logical clock algorithm assigns a value, called the logical time,
  to each event in a computation so that all sequences of events in
  ascending logical time are computations.

  </p>

   
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  Design an algorithm that assigns numbers to events in a computation
  so that all sequences of events in ascending logical time are computations.


   
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
The problem deals with sequences of events and computations.  So,
  start with theorems about event sequences and computations.

  <p>

  <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
  A computation is a topological sort of the dataflow graph
  </a>
  -- i.e., a
  computation is sequence of events in which for all edges
  \((e, e')\) in the dataflow graph \(e\) occurs before \(e'\) in the
  sequence.

  <p>
  If \(t(e) < t(e')\) then \(e\) occurs before \(e'\) in all ascending
  sequences of logical time.
  
  These observations suggest the logical time property.
  

  
  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
  <h4 style="color:blue;">The Logical Time Property</h4>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  All sequences in ascending logical time are computations if 
  for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph of a computation:
\(t(e) < t(e')\).
</p>
<hr class="new2">



  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: Logical Times of Events</h5>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  
  Figure 1 shows the dataflow graph of a computation with agents
  \(A, B, C\) and an event sequence \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, ]\).

  The numbers inside the vertices are the event ids which show the
  position of the event in the computation.

  The red numbers outside the events are logical times assigned to
  events.

  <p>
  Logical times are arbitrary provided
  every edge is directed from a lower to a higer logical time.

    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.001.jpeg"
  alt="Fig1" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 1: Logical Times of Events</figcaption>
  </figure>


  

  
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Logical Clock Algorithm</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
The following algorithm is suggested by the logical time property.

Let \(t(e)\) be the logical time assigned to event \(e\).

A message sent in an event \(e\) is assigned a timestamp \(t(e)\).

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
Let \(e'\) be the event immediately preceding an event \(e\) at an
agent, and let the timestamp of the message received in \(e\) be
\(T\).
<p style="color:blue;">
Set \(t(e)\) to be any value greater than max(t(e'), T).
<hr class="new2">

<p>
The correctness of the algorithm is self evident.


  
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Past, Future and State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->


  <p>
  The <i>past at logical time \(t\)</i> is defined as the set of events  with logical
time at most \(t\).

The <i>future at logical \(t\)</i> is the set of events  with logical
time greater than \(t\).

The <i>point at logical time \(t\)</i> on an agent \(u\)'s computation is an
edge between a past and future event at logical time \(t\) at \(u\).

The <i>slice at logical time \(t\)</i> is given by the points at
logical time \(t\).

<p>
  The past at \(t\) is closed because there is no edge
  from an event with logical time greater than \(t\) to an event with
  logical time at most \(t\).


  <p>
  The state of an agent at logical time \(t\) is the label of the
  agent edge from the past to the future. 

The state of a channel at logical time \(t\) is the sequence of messages sent along the
channel in the past and received in the future. 


<!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 style="color:red;">Example: State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->
Figure 2 illustrates the state at logical time 6.5 of the
computation shown in figure 1.

  The curved purple line represents the slice.

  The slice separates the past of the slice from its future.

  Past events are colored black while future events are colored
green.

The states of agents and channels at logical time \(t = 6.5\) are
given by the labels of the edges that cut the purple line.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.002.jpeg"
  alt="Fig2" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 2: States at Logical Time 6.5</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The point at which the purple line cuts the timeline for agent \(A\)
can be thought of as the point in \(A\)'s computation at which the
logical time is exactly 6.5.

This cut is on the edge from the event at \(A\) with
  logical time at most 6.5 to the event with logical time greater
  than 6.5.

  In this example the cut is on the edge from event 3 to event 5.

  <p>
  The message edge from event 3 to event 7 represents a message sent
  along the channel from \(A\) to \(B\) in the past that is received
  in the future.

In this example, the state of the channel \((A, B)\) is the sequence
consisting of a 
single message which is the label of this edge.




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
Global snapshot algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\)
</h4>

An algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\) follows
directly from the definition of the state at logical time \(t\).

<ol>
  <li>
Each agent takes its local snapshot -- i.e. records its state -- after
an event with logical time at most \(t\) and before an
  event with logical time greater than \(t\).
  </li>
  <li>
An agent records the state of an input channel as the sequence of
messages with timestamps atmost \(t\) that the agent
  receives when its logical clock exceeds \(t\).
  </li>
</ol>

The purple line in figure 2 represents the global snapshot at logical
time 6.5.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Using Imperfect Clocks in Distributed Algorithms</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Intuition</p>
  It can help intuition, as we design algorithms for some problems, to think of 
logical time playing the role of real time.
Figure 3 shows the computation in figure 2 with the horizontal axis
representing real time.
The position of an event with logical time \(t\) is at a distance of
\(t\) units from the origin.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.003.jpeg"
  alt="Fig3" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 3: Computation with Logical Time as Real Time</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Thinks of logical time as continuous, just as real time is continuous.
In this example, points at logical time \(6.5\) and \(6.6\) at agent
\(A\) refer to the same edge; however, it helps intuition to think
of the point at logical time \(6.6\) as a location to the right of the
point at logical time \(6.5\) on the same edge.

<p>
The slice at logical time \(6.5\) is represented by the vertical line
at time \(6.5\).
The left of the line is the past, and the right side of the line is
the future at that time.


  
<p class="w3-text-teal">Properties shared by Perfect and Imperfect Clocks</p>
Perfect clocks have many useful properties including the following:

<ol>

  <li>

  Clocks tick forward forever: For all \(t\), there is a point in
  an infinite computation at which clocks of all agents exceed \(t\).
  </li>

  <li>

  Sequences of events in ascending order of time are computations.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Operating systems maintain clocks. Some have atomic clocks or other
  high-fidelity clocks that use Precision or 
Network Time Protocols (PTP, NTP).

These clocks have property 1.

<p>
We can use the logical clock algorithm to adjust these clocks to get
property 2:
move an agent's clock forward so that the time at which a message is
received, as determined by the receiver's clock, is later than the
timestamp of the message.

<p>
We use clocks with these two properties in many algorithms, and we employ the following
heuristic.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">A Design Heuristic</h5>
A heuristic is to design algorithms in two steps.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>First step:</i>
Design an algorithm assuming that
  clocks are perfect.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Second step:</i> Check whether the algorithm is correct with
  imperfect clocks that have properties 1 and 2.
  In some cases we will need to use only one of the two properties.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Here are a couple of examples of applications of the heuristic.

Let's design a global snapshot algorithm using the heuristic.
First step: When clocks are perfect, the algorithm is trivial.
Each agent takes a local snapshot at exactly the same time \(t\).
Second step: Prove the correctness of the same algorithm even though
clocks are imperfect.


<p>
Another example: design an algorithm to to take repeated
snapshots. First step: With perfect clocks, the algorithm is
straightforward. Each agent records its 
state periodically with some period \(T\).
Second step: Prove the correctness of the same algorithm even though
clocks are imperfect.

<p>
We use this heuristic in designing other problems that are described
in later webpages.
