    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Partially Synchronous Algorithms</h2>
    
  In this section we develop a method that allows us to design
  some distributed algorithms so that we can reason about the
  correctness of the algorithms assuming that
  messages are delivered instantaneously and agents operate
  synchronously.
  Reasoning about algorithms in which agents operate in lock
  step is often easier than designing asynchronous algorithms.
  The central idea is assigning a <i>sync-time</i> to each event so
  that events in which a message is sent and received have the same
  sync-times. So, in terms of sync-times, messages are instantaneous.
  
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Synch-Times</p>
  Associated with each agent <code>P</code> is a local variable
  <code>P.t</code> which is called <code>P</code>'s synchronous time
  or <i>synch time</i>.
  We associate a sync-time <code>e.t</code> with each event
  <code>e</code>.
  If event <code>e</code> occurs at agent
  <code>P</code> then <code>e.t</code> is the value of
  <code>P.t</code> at the point at which <code>e</code> occurs.
  With each message <code>M</code> we associate a field
  <code>M.t</code> called the message's sync-time, where 
  <code>M.t</code> is the sync-time of the event in which
  <code>M</code> is sent.
  <p>
  As a trajectory grows, an agent's sync-time may remain unchanged
  or increase, but never decreases.
  Therefore, in a trajectory, earlier events at an
  agent have sync-times that are less than or equal to sync-times
  of later events at the <i>same</i> agent.
  It is possible, however, for 
  earlier events in a trajectory at one
  agent to have sync-times that are greater than sync-times
  of later events at a <i>different</i> agent.

  <p>
  The action of receiving a message occurs in two steps:
  <ol>
    <li><i>Message Delivery</i>: A message is delivered to the
  receiver which inspects the message but takes no action other than
  to modify the receiver's sync-time.
    </li>
    <li><i>Message Processing</i>: The receiver executes the event due
  to the arrival of the message. The receiver may change its state and
    send messages in this event.
    </li>
   </ol>
    
  
  We design algorithms in which sync-times have the following property.
  <p>
  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
  Key property of sync-times:
   The sync-time of an event in which a message <code>M</code> is sent
   is the 
   the sync-time of the event in which <code>M</code> is processed.
  </p>
  <hr class="new2">
  
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Rules that ensure the sync-times
   property</p>
   Let <code>d</code> be the event in which a message <code>M</code>
   is sent, and let <code>e</code> be the event in which
   <code>M</code> is received. Let
   <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> be the agents that send and
   receive <code>M</code>, respectively.
  <ol>
    <li>
    When <code>P</code> sends <code>M</code>, it
    sets <code>M.t</code> to <code>P.t</code>, which is also the
    sync-time <code>d.t</code> of this event. So
    <code>d.t = M.t</code>
    </li>
    <li>
    If <code>Q</code> receives
    <code>M</code> where <code>M.t < Q.t</code>, it
    does not process the message.
    So <code>Q</code>'s state does not change when <code>M</code> is
   received and there is no event associated with processing
   <code>M</code>. 
    </li>
    <li>
    When <code>Q</code> receives <code>M</code>
    where <code>M.t</code> \(\geq\) <code>Q.t</code>, it may or may
    not process the message, depending on the specific algorithm.
    If <code>Q</code> does process the message,
    <code>Q</code> first
    sets <code>Q.t </code> to <code>M.t</code> and 
    next
    executes event <code>e</code> that processes <code>M</code>.
    So <code>e.t = M.t</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  The proof that the key property of sync times, <code>d.t = M.t =
   e.t</code>, is straightforward. 



    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Synchronous Versions of Asynchronous
Computations</h4>
Let <code>X</code> be a trajectory of a system in which agents have
sync-times that satisfy the above rules. 
Let <code>Y</code> be a permutation of <code>X</code> where
  the timelines of each agent are the same in <code>X</code> and
  <code>Y</code>, and events
  appear in increasing order of sync-times in <code>Y</code>.
  Then <code>Y</code> is also a trajectory of the system.

  <p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
  An event <code>e</code>
  depends on an event <code>e'</code> only if <code>e'.t</code>
  \(\leq\) 
  <code>e.t</code>. A sequence of events in which each event occurs
  after all events on which it depends is also a trajectory.
