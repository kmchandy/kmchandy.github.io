    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h1>
    
    In this module we adapt the algorithm given earlier in 
    <a href="../GlobalSnapshots/GlobalSnapshots.html"> the module on
    global snapshots</a> to the case where shared variables are
    channels. We apply the concepts of 
    <a href="../LogicalClocks/LogicalClocks.html"> timestamps and
    logical clocks</a> to distributed systems.

    
    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Snapshot Algorithm: The Idea</h3>
    The snapshot algorithm determines the state at a consistent cut.
    A cut is inconsistent when it has an edge from its future to its
    past.The algorithm uses a special message,
    called a marker, to obtain a cut where every edge from the
    future is to the future.

    <p>
    We use the phrase "an agent B takes its local snapshot" for "an
    agent B records B's state." The global snapshot is a collection of
    local snapshots. Key questions are <i>when</i> does an agent take
    its own snapshot, and how do agents collaborate to take snapshots
    of channels?
    

    
    <h3 style="color:red;">Example of an Inconsistent Cut</h3>
    Figure 1 shows an inconsistent cut.
    The point at which agents record their states are the points at
    which the curvy purple line (the cut)
    crosses the agent timelines; these points are marked as yellow
    circles. Events that an agent executes after it records its
    state are in the future with respect to the cut. So, for example,
    event \(10\) is in the future 
    because agent \(B\) records its state before event \(10\), and
    event \(11\) is in the past because agent
    \(C\) records its state after event \(11\).
    <figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots_1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: An inconsistent cut</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
    This cut is inconsistent because there is an edge \((10, 11)\)
    from the future to the past. Next we give
    an algorithm that avoids this situation.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Global snapshot algorithm with channels</h3>
    Each agent records its state exactly once.
<ol>
  <li>
  The algorithm begins by one or more agents recording their states.
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent records its state it sends a special message on each
  of its outgoing channels. We call this message a <i>marker</i>. A
  marker is distinct from all other messages.
  </li>
  <li>
  An agent that hasn't recorded its state does so when it receives a
  marker.
  </li>
</ol>
We assume that the agent communication graph is strongly connected:
    there is a path of directed channels from each agent to every
    other agent. 

<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Figure 2 illustrates the algorithm. When B takes its
records its state it sends markers on its
to A and C. These are shown as green edges.
Agent C records its state when it receives the marker
which ensures that it records its state before event 11.
This makes event 11 in the future in figure 2 whereas it is in the
past in figure 1.
The problem shown in figure 1 ---
of an edge from the future to the past  --- does not appear in figure 2.



    <figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots_2.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Markers ensure cuts are consistent</figcaption>
    </figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</h4>
We prove that the points at which agents record their states form a
consistent cut. We do so by proving that all edges from future events
are to future events.

<p>
When an agent records its state it sends markers on its outgoing
channels. So events that an agent executes after it sends markers are
in the future. When an agent receives a marker it records its state if
it hasn't done so. Therefore, events that an agent executes after it
receives a marker are in the future. So, a message sent in a future
event is received in a future event.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Snapshots of Channels</h4>
The state of a channel \(x\) from an agent \(A\) to an
agent \(B\), at a cut, is the sequence of messages that \(A\) sent along \(x\)
in the past and that are received by \(B\) in the future.

<p>
The messages that \(A\) sent along \(x\) in the past are the messages
that \(A\) sent along \(x\) before it sent the marker along \(x\).
Because channels are first-in-first-out, the messages that \(A\) sent
along \(x\) in the past are the messages that \(B\) receives along
\(x\) before \(B\) receives the marker along \(x\).

<p>
The messages that \(B\) receives along \(x\) in the future are the
messages that \(B\) receives after it records its state.

So, the state of \(x\) at the cut is the sequence of messages that
\(B\) receives along \(x\) after \(B\) records its state and before
\(B\) receives a marker along \(x\)

<h3 style="color:red;">Example: Channel Snapshot</h3>
A diagram that illustrates the process by which an agent gets a
snapshot of an incoming channel is shown below. The diagram shows the
timelines for two agents, \(A\) and \(B\).

<p>
Agent \(A\) sends messages \(m_{0}, m_{1}, m_{2}\), then sends a
marker (colored green), and then message \(m_{3}\), to agent \(B\) on a
channel \(x\). All the messages in the diagram are sent on the same
channel.

<p>
The events shown as blue circles on \(A\)'s timeline are
events in which \(A\) sends messages \(m_{0}, m_{1}, m_{2}\) before
\(A\) takes its local snapshot.  The event shown as a black circle
shows \(A\) sending messages \(m_{3}\) after \(A\) takes its local
snapshot. The point at which \(A\) takes its local snapshot is the
point at which the purple wavy line (the cut) crosses \(A\)'s timeline.

    <figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots_3.jpg" alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Snapshot of a channel</figcaption>
    </figure>

The event shown as a yellow circle on \(B\)'s timeline represents the
event in which \(B\) receives messages \(m_{0}\) before \(B\) takes its
own snapshot. The events shown as organge circles represent events in
which \(B\) receives messages \(m_{1}, m_{2}\) after \(B\) takes its
own snapshot and before \(B\) receives the marker. The black event
represents \(B\) receiving message \(m_{3}\) after \(B\) takes its
snapshot.

<p>
The messages that \(A\) sent in the past are \(m_{0}, m_{1}, m_{2}\).
The messages that \(B\) receives in the future are \(m_{1}, m_{2},
m_{3}, \ldots\).
The state of the channel, at the cut, is the sequence of messages \([m_{1},
m_{2}]\) that \(A\) sent in the past and that \(B\) receives in the
future.
This is shown as the sequence of red message lines that
cross the wavy purple line which represents the global snapshot.
These are the messages that \(B\) receives after it takes its local
snapshot and before it receives the marker.



<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Logical clocks with channels</h2>
Next, we extend the idea of 
<a href="../TimelineDiagrams/TimelineDiagrams.html">logical clocks</a>
to distributed systems.

<p>
Each event is assigned a
timestamp such that for every edge \((e, e')\) in the timeline graph,
the timestamp for \(e'\) is strictly greater than the timestamp for
\(e\). Figure 4 gives two examples of timestamps that satisfy this
criterion. Both examples are for the same timeline diagram. In both
diagrams, the top horizontal line is the timeline for an agent A, and
the bottom line for agent B. Messages between the agents are shown as
red lines.

    <figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots_4.jpg" alt="Fig4" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Two examples of timestamps</figcaption>
</figure>

In the diagram, message lines are
timestamped with a value greater than or equal to the timestamp of the
sending event. Because the timestamps shown in figure 4 are
consistent, cuts at any timestamp \(t\) are also consistent.

Figure 5 has examples of consistent cuts corresponding to timestamps
of 32 and 60 for the lower timeline diagram of figure 4.

    <figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots_5.jpg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Consistent cuts at two timestamps</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm for Logical Clocks</h3>
An algorithm that obeys the following rules assigns consistent
timestamps.

<ol>
  <li>
  An agent assigns a timestamp \(t\) to an event \(e\) where \(t\) is
  greater than the timestamp assigned to the most recent event executed
  by the agent before \(e\).
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent assigns a timestamp \(t\) to an event that sends a
  message \(m\) the agent also assigns timestamp \(t'\) to \(m\) where
  \(t' \geq t\).
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent receives a message with timestamp \(t\) the agent
  assigns a timestamp \(t'\) to the receive event where \(t' > t\).
  </li>
</ol>

<P class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The proof of correctness --- i.e. the algorithm assigns consistent
timestamps --- is straightforward.

clocks to distributed systems.
