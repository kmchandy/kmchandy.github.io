<h1 class="w3-text-teal">A Global Snapshot Algorithm</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A global snapshot algorithm determines a state that can occur during
  a computation.

  The state obtained by the algorithm is called a global snapshot.

  Systems are monitored by taking repeated global snapshots.

  When a transient error is detected, a rollback and recovery
  algorithm restarts the computation from the most recent snapshot
  instead of starting it from the initial state.

  

  

  </p>
 
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  A global snapshot algorithm determines an intermediate state in a
  computation.

  A global snapshot is a state that can occur after the state in which
  the global snapshot algorithm starts and before the state in which
  the algorithm ends.

  This page describes a global snapshot algorithm.

  <p>
  The global snapshot algorithm is an example of an algorithm that is
  executed by a distributed operating system (OS) on behalf of a
  client.

  Next, we describe features of the OS that are relevant to the
  snapshot algorithm.

  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Distributed Operating System</h4>
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  
  
  Each client agent has an OS agent that supervises it.

  OS agents use the same processors and channels as clients do.
  
  OS agents can record, but not modify, states of their clients.
  
  OS agents can send and receive OS messages that are not seen
by clients.

<p>
Figure 1 is a representation of two OS agents that manage their
client agents.

Messages sent by a client are recorded by the OS and passed through
to destination clients.

The OS sends messages on the same channels as clients, but the OS
traps these messages so that the client does not see them.


<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1"
    style="width:60%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: OS and Clients use the same Channels</figcaption>
</figure> 

  <p>
  Execution of an OS agent on a processor may delay a client's
  events on the same processor, and thus change the order in which the
  client's events are executed. 

<i>The OS may change a client's computation -- the event order -- but
the OS must not change the client's dataflow.</i>
  
  <p>
  One way to record a global snapshot is for the OS to stop a client
  computation, then take a global snapshot, and then  restart the
client computation.

Our goal is to design an algorithm that does not stop the client.

<p>
Hereafter, when we refer to an agent we mean an OS agent.

Likewise, by messages we mean those that are sent and received by the
OS.



 
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The state at a <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
slice</a> is a state that can occur in a computation.

So we design the global snapshot algorithm to determine a global
snapshot -- a state at a slice.

<p>
Each agent records its own state -- takes its local snapshot -- at
some point in a computation.

Define <code>past</code> as the set of events at an agent before the
agent takes its local snapshot.

The definition of a slice is that all events <code>before</code> <code>past</code> events
are <code>past</code> events.
An equivalent definition of a slice is that all events <code>after</code> <code>future</code> events
are <code>future</code> events.

An event in which a message is sent is <code>before</code> the event
in which the message is received, and a message is received
<code>after</code> it is sent.

<p>
So, local snapshots correspond to a global snapshot exactly when:
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
Messages received in the <code>past</code> are sent in the <code>past</code>, i.e.
<p style="color:blue;">
Each message received before the receiver takes its snapshot
is sent before the sender takes its snapshot.
<p>
Or equivalently,
<p style="color:blue;">
Messages sent in the <code>future</code> are received in the
<code>future</code>, i.e.
<p style="color:blue;">
Each message sent after the sender takes its snapshot
is received after the receiver takes its snapshot.
</p>
<hr class="new2">


<p>
The central question in designing the algorithm is:
How should the algorithm separate messages sent in <code>past</code>
from messages sent in <code>future</code>?


A special OS message, called a <code>marker</code> is used for this
purpose.
Messages sent on a channel before a <code>marker</code> is sent on the
channel are messages sent in the <code>past</code>, and messages sent
after the marker are sent in the <code>future</code>.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<p class="w3-text-teal">The algorithm</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  The algorithm begins by one or more agents taking their local
  snapshots.
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent takes its local snapshot it sends a marker on each
  of its outgoing channels. 
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent receives a marker, the agent takes its local snapshot
  if it has not already done so. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The snapshot of a channel is the sequence of messages received on
  the channel after the receiver takes its snapshot and before the
  receiver receives a marker on the channel.
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</h5>

<p>
From rule 2, messages sent on a channel after the marker is sent on
the channel
are sent after the sender takes its snapshot; so, these messages are
sent in <code>future</code>.

From rule 3, messages received after a marker are messages received
after the receiver takes its snapshot; so these messages are received
in <code>future</code>.

Therefore all messages sent in <code>future</code> are received in
<code>future</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof about States of Channels</p>
The messages in a channel at the slice are the
messages sent in <code>past</code> and received in <code>future</code>.
These are messages sent before the sender takes its snapshot and
received after the receiver takes its snapshot.

So, the state of a channel is the sequence of
messages received along the channel after the receiver takes its
snapshot and before the receiver receives a marker along the channel.

<p>
Note: If an agent takes its local snapshot when it receives a marker
along a channel, then the snapshot of the channel is the empty
sequence of messages.

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Termination of the Algorithm</h5>

After any agent \(v\) initiates the algorithm, all agents that are
reachable from \(v\) will receive a marker and take their local
snapshots.

If every agent is reachable from an initiator then all agents take
local snapshots. 

<p>
Each agent takes its local snapshot at most once.

So, a marker is sent on a channel at most once.

The computation terminates when all markers are received.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Code Structure</h5>
The code outline is given below in Python.

<i>channels_recorded</i> is a dict (dictionary), where
<i>channels_recorded[sender]</i> becomes True when the snapshot for
the channel from this sender has finished being recorded.
<i>channel_snapshots</i> is a dict where
<i>channel_snapshots[sender]</i> is the ongoing recording of the
snapshot of the channel from the sender.

<pre>
taken_local_snapshot = False
channel_snapshots = {key: [] for key in predecessors}
channels_recorded = {key: False for key in predecessors}

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, Marker) and not taken_local_snapshot:
        local_snapshot = record_state()
        taken_local_snapshot = True
        channels_recorded[sender] = True
        output_message = Marker()
        for receiver in successors:
            send(output_message, receiver)
   elif isinstance(message, Marker) and taken_local_snapshot:
        channels_recorded[sender] = True
   else: 
        if taken_local_snapshot and not channels_recorded[sender]:
           channel_snapshots[sender] = \\ 
                       channel_snapshots[sender].append(message)
</pre>



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Collecting Local Snapshots to form Global
Snapshots</h5>
One way to collect local snapshots is to have an OS agent act as an
observer.

Each agent sends its local snapshots to the observer which puts the
local snapshots together to form the global snapshots.

Successive snapshots are disambiguated by using sequence numbers or
timestamps.

<p>
Some algorithms carry out distributed computations on local snapshots
without forming a global snapshot.

We give examples of such algorithms in this chapter.


The remainder of this webpage consists of examples.

<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Snapshots may change a Client's Computation
</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
This example shows that the OS algorithm may change a client's
computation though it does not change the client's dataflow.

<p>
Figure 2 is a representation of a computation with event sequence
\([0, 1, 2, \ldots, ]\) and agents \(X, Y, Z\) without a concurrent OS
algorithm, and figure 3 shows how the OS changes this computation.

Events later in the computation are placed to the
right of earlier events.

<figcaption>
Fig.2: Representation of a Computation without Snapshots
</figcaption> 
</figure> 


<p>
Figure 3 shows how a client's computation is changed when the OS takes
snapshots. 

The local snapshots taken by agents are shown as a yellow
circle on the agents' timelines.

The OS delays event 3 so that it occurs after events 4, 5, 6, and 7,
as shown in the figure.

The OS changes the computation, but it does not change the dataflow.

<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.003.jpeg" alt="Fig2"
    style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: The OS changes a Client's Computation</figcaption>
</figure> 

In figure 3, the pre-snapshot events are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.

There is only one message received in a pre-snapshot
event, namely the message represented by the edge (0, 2).

So, every message received in a pre-snapshot event is sent in a
pre-snapshot event.

The figure shows that the set of pre-snapshot events is closed.


<!---------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Steps in a Global Snapshot
Algorithm: Initiation</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->

Figure 4 illustrates the first step of the algorithm.

    <figcaption>Fig.4: Agent Sends Markers when it Takes its Local
    Snapshot</figcaption> 
</figure>

Agent Y takes its local snapshot shown as a yellow vertex on Y's
timeline.

When Y takes its snapshot it sends markers on its output channels.

The markers are shown as green edges in the figure.


<p>
When agents X and Z each receive the markers, they take their local
snapshots because they haven't taken snapshots earlier.

<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.006.jpeg" alt="Fig5"
    style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.5: Agents Take Local Snapshots when they Receive Markers
</figcaption>
</figure>

The actions by X and Z of taking their snapshots are shown as yellow
vertices on their timelines in figure 5.


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Agents take Snapshots upon Receiving Markers</h4> 
<!--------------------------------------------------->
<p>
When X and Z take their snapshots they send markers out on their
output channels.

The markers sent by X are shown in figure 7.

The markers sent by Z are not shown in the figure.

<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.007.jpeg" alt="Fig6"
    style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.6: When an Agent takes its Snapshot it sends Markers.
    </figcaption>
</figure>



<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Snapshot of a Channel</h4> 
<!--------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Figure 8 shows how agent Y determines the state of the channel from X
to Y in the global snapshot.

Y starts recording the messages it receives along this channel after Y
takes its snapshot and stops the recording when it receives a marker
on this channel

The only message in this interval is the message corresponding to edge
(6, 7).


<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.008.jpeg" alt="Fig7"
    style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.7: Example: Recording a Channel State
</figcaption>
</figure> 

The message corresponding to edge \((0, 2)\) is from X to Y but is not
in the snapshot of 
the channel because both \(0\) and \(2\) are pre-snapshot events.

Likewise, the message corresponding to edge \((12, 13)\) is from X to
Y but is not in the snapshot of
the channel because both \(12\) and \(13\) are post-snapshot events.

The message corresponding to edge \((6, 7)\) was sent in a
pre-snapshot event and received in a post-snapshot event, and so it is
in the snapshot of the channel.
