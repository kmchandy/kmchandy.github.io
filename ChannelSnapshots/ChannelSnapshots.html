<h1 class="w3-text-teal">A Global Snapshot Algorithm</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A global snapshot algorithm records a state that can
  occur during a computation.

  The state obtained by the algorithm is called a global snapshot.

  Systems are monitored by taking repeated global snapshots.

  When a transient error is detected, a rollback and recovery
  algorithm restarts the computation from the most recent snapshot
  instead of starting it from the initial state.

  <p>
  A state of the system is a tuple with an element of the tuple for
  each agent and each channel.
  In this page, we also call the state of a system a <i>global
  state</i> or a <i>system state</i> to distinguish it from
  states of agents and states of channels.
    </p>

    <p>
    A global snapshot algorithm is an algorithm that records the
    global state of a system.
  An algorithm to record the global state of a system is not instantaneous
  because the algorithm records the states of multiple agents and
  channels.
  A global snapshot algorithm starts in some state \(S_{init}\) and terminates
  later at a state \(S_{fini}\).
  A global snapshot is a state <code>S*</code> such that there exists a
    computation that starts at \(S_{init}\), then visits
    \(S^{*}\) and then visits \(S_{fini}\).
    </p>


  <p>
  The global snapshot algorithm is an example of an algorithm that is
  executed by a distributed operating system (OS) on behalf of a
    client.
    </div>
    <!-----END SECTION: DefinitionOfGlobalSnapshot ------------>

    
  Next, we describe features of the OS that are relevant to the
  snapshot algorithm.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Distributed Operating System</h4>
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  
  <p>
  Each client agent has an OS agent that supervises it.
  OS agents use the same processors and channels as clients do.
  OS agents can record, but not modify, states of their clients.
  OS agents can send and receive OS messages that are not seen
    by clients.
    </p>

<p>
Figure 1 is a representation of two OS agents that manage their
client agents.
Messages sent by a client are recorded by the OS and passed through
to destination clients.
The OS sends messages on the same channels as clients, but the OS
traps these messages so that the client does not see them.
</p>

<figure>

    style="width:60%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: OS and Clients use the same Channels</figcaption>
</figure> 

  <p>
  Execution of an OS agent on a processor may delay a client's
  steps on the same processor, and thus change the order in which the
  client's steps are executed. 
<i>The OS may change a client's computation -- the order of steps -- but
    the OS must not change the client's dataflow.</i>
    </p>
  
  <p>
  One way to record a global snapshot is for the OS to stop a client
  computation, then take a global snapshot, and then  restart the
client computation.
    Our goal is to design an algorithm that does not stop the client.
    </p>

<p>
Hereafter, when we refer to an agent in this webpage we mean an OS agent.
Likewise, by messages we mean those that are sent and received by the
    OS.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specification of a Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<p>
Let \(S_{init}\) and \(S_{fini}\) be the states in which the
global snapshot algorithm starts and finishes, respectively.
The problem is to design a global snapshot algorithm that records a
  state \(S^{*}\) such that 
there exists a computation that starts at \(S_{init}\), then visits
\(S^{*}\) and then visits \(S_{fini}\).
</p>


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Strategy</p>
  <p>
A strategy for developing algorithms dealing with states that occur
  during a computation is
to use <a href="Timelines.html#DefinitionOfCut"> 
properties of consistent cuts</a>.
The theorem
<a href="Timelines.html#TheoremComputationsAndCuts">"Computations and Cuts," </a>
tells us that \(S^{*}\) can be the state at any consistent cut.
Our tasks reduce to (1) identifying a consistent cut, and
(2) recording the state, \(S^{*}\), at the cut.
</p>


<!------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Identifying a Cut</h5>
  <p>
Each agent has to record its own state because an agent's state is not
accessible to other agents.
The state of an agent <code>v</code> recorded by
  <code>v</code> is called a <i>local snapshot</i> of <code>v</code>.
  </p>
  
<p>
A partition of the steps of a computation into <code>past</code> and
<code>future</code> is a consistent cut <code>(past, future)</code> exactly when
all edges to vertices in <code>past</code> are from vertices in
<code>past</code>.
In our algorithm, let <code>past</code> be the set of steps at each
    agent <code>v</code> before <code>v</code> takes its local snapshot.
</p>


<p>
To prove that the cut is consistent we need only prove that all
messages to steps in <code>past</code> are from steps 
in <code>past</code>.
And this condition is guaranteed by the following rule.
</p>


<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">Global Snapshot Rule</p>
<p style="color:blue;">
Each message received before the receiver takes its local snapshot
is sent before the sender takes its local snapshot.
<p>
<hr class="new2">
<p>
We now use the global snapshot rule to develop an algorithm.
</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
A special OS message called a <code>marker</code> is used to distinguish
pre-snapshot from post-snapshot messages.
Messages sent on a channel before a <code>marker</code> is sent on the
channel are messages sent in the <code>past</code> -- i.e. before the
sender takes its local snapshot -- and messages sent
after the marker are sent in the <code>future</code>.
</p>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Steps of the global snapshot algorithm</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  The algorithm begins by one or more agents taking their local
  snapshots. Any number of agents can initiate the global snapshot
  algorithm. 
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent takes its local snapshot it sends a marker on each
  of its outgoing channels. An agent takes its local snapshot exactly
  once. For each channel, exactly one marker is sent on the channel.
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent receives a marker, the agent takes its local snapshot
  if it has not already done so. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The snapshot of a channel is the sequence of messages received on
  the channel after the receiver takes its local snapshot and before the
  receiver receives a marker on the channel.
  </li>
</ol>

       <!-----START SECTION: Proof of Correctness ------------>
  <div id="SECTION", class="Proof">
    <a name="Proof"></a>
    
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</h5>

    <p>
    We will prove that the algorithm satisfies the global snapshot
    rule: If an agent <code>v</code> received a message
    <code>m</code>  on a channel <code>(u, v)</code> before
    <code>v</code> took its local snapshot then agent <code>u</code>
    sent <code>m</code> before <code>u</code> took its local
    snapshot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume that agent <code>v</code> received a message
    <code>m</code>  on a channel <code>(u, v)</code> before
    <code>v</code> took its local snapshot.
    We will prove that agent <code>u</code>
    sent <code>m</code> before <code>u</code> took its local
    snapshot.
    </p>

    <p>
    From rule 3, <code>v</code> takes its local snapshot when it
    receives its first marker (which may arrive on any channel).
    So, <code>v</code> received <code>m</code> before <code>v</code>
    received the marker on channel <code>(u, v)</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Channels are first in first out.
    Because <code>v</code> received <code>m</code> before <code>v</code>
    received the marker on channel <code>(u, v)</code>, it follows
    that <code>u</code> sent <code>m</code> before <code>u</code>
    sent the marker on channel <code>(u, v)</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    From rule 2, <code>u</code> sent the marker on channel <code>(u,
    v)</code> when <code>u</code> took its local snapshot.
    So <code>u</code> sent <code>m</code> before <code>u</code> took
    its local snapshot.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof about States of Channels</p>
    <p>
The messages in a channel at the cut are the
messages sent in <code>past</code> and received in <code>future</code>.
These are messages sent before the sender takes its snapshot and
received after the receiver takes its snapshot.
So, the state of a channel is the sequence of
messages received along the channel after the receiver takes its
snapshot and before the receiver receives a marker along the channel.
    </p>
    
<p>
Note: If an agent takes its local snapshot when it receives a marker
along a channel, then the snapshot of the channel is the empty
    sequence of messages.
    </p>

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Termination of the Algorithm</h5>
<p>
After any agent \(v\) initiates the algorithm, all agents that are
reachable from \(v\) will receive a marker and take their local
snapshots.
If every agent is reachable from an initiator then all agents take
local snapshots. 
    </p>
    
<p>
Each agent takes its local snapshot at most once.
So, a marker is sent on a channel at most once.
The computation terminates when all markers are received.
