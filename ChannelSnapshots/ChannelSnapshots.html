<h1 class="w3-text-teal">A Global Snapshot Algorithm</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
 A global snapshot algorithm determines an intermediate state in a
  computation between the states in which the global snapshot algorithm
  starts and ends.

  This intermediate state is called a <i>global snapshot</i>.
  
  Systems are monitored by taking repeated global snapshots.

  When a transient error is detected, a rollback and recovery
  algorithm restarts the computation from the most recent global
  snapshot instead of starting it again from the beginning.

  </p>
 
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  A global snapshot algorithm determines an intermediate state in a
  computation between the states in which a global snapshot algorithm
  starts and ends.
  
  This intermediate state is
  called a <i>global snapshot</i> to distinguish it from a <i>local</i>
  snapshot which is a recording of the state of a single agent or a
  single channel.

  <p>
  The global snapshot algorithm is an example of an algorithm that is
  executed by a distributed operating system (OS) on behalf of a
  client.

  Next, we describe features of the OS that are relevant to the
  snapshot algorithm.

  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Distributed Operating System</h4>
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  
  
  Each client agent has an OS agent that supervises it.

  OS agents use the same processors and channels as clients do.
  
  OS agents can record, but not modify, states of their clients.
  
  OS agents can send and receive OS messages that are not seen
by clients.

<p>
Figure 1 is a representation of two OS agents that manage their
client agents.

Messages sent by a client are recorded by the OS and passed through
to destination clients.

The OS sends messages on the same channels as clients, but the OS
traps these messages so that the client does not see them.


<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1"
    style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: OS and Clients use the same Channels</figcaption>
</figure> 

  <p>
  Execution of an OS agent on a processor may delay a client's
  events on the same processor, and thus change the order in which the
  client's events are executed. 

<i>The OS may change a client's computation -- the event order -- but
the OS must not change the client's dataflow.</i>
  
  <p>
  One way to record a global snapshot is for the OS to stop a client
  computation, then take a global snapshot, and then  restart the
client computation.

Our goal is to design an algorithm that does not stop the client.

<p>
Hereafter, when we refer to an agent we mean an OS agent.

Likewise, by messages we mean those that are sent and received by the
OS.



 
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The problem is to record a state of a computation after the state
in which the global snapshot algorithm starts and before the state at which the
global snapshot ends.

The phrases "before the state" and "after the state" in the problem
definition suggest that we use
theorems about past (before) and future (after).

So, lets look at 
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">the theorem about past and future</a>.


<p>
In any snapshot algorithm, each agent must record its own local state at some
point in its computation because another agent cannot do so.

Let's look at the slice consisting of the points at which agents take
 local snapshots --  i.e., record their states.

<p>
In this slice, a past event is an event at an agent
before the agent takes its local snapshot, and a future event is an event at an agent
after the agent takes its local snapshot.

The theorem about past and future says that a slice is closed if every
message sent in the future is received in the future.

This gives us the key to the solution.

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
A slice consisting of points at which agents take local snapshots is
closed if:
<p style="color:blue;">
every message sent after the sender takes its local snapshot is
received after the receiver takes its local snapshot.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

Next, let's design an algorithm based on this insight.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


The insight tells us that we must distinguish messages sent before the
sender takes its snapshot from those sent after the snapshot.

We use a special message called a <i>marker</i> for this purpose.

Markers are used only by the OS and are not seen by clients.


<p class="w3-text-teal">The algorithm</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  The algorithm begins by one or more agents taking their local
  snapshots.
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent takes its local snapshot it sends a marker on each
  of its outgoing channels. 
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent receives a marker, the agent takes its local snapshot
  if it has not already done so. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The snapshot of a channel is the sequence of messages received on
  the channel after the receiver takes its snapshot and before the
  receiver receives a marker on the channel.
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</h5>
Channels are first in first out.

All messages sent on a channel after a marker
are received after the marker. 

<p>
From rule 2, messages sent on a channel after the marker
are sent after the sender takes its snapshot.

From rule 3, messages received after a marker are messages received
after the receiver takes its snapshot.

So, messages sent after the sender takes its snapshot are received
after the receiver takes its snapshot.
<p>
Therefore, the slice consisting of points at which agents take local snapshots is
closed.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof about Snapshots of Channels</p>
The messages in a channel at the slice are the
messages sent in the past and received in the future.
These are messages sent before the sender takes its snapshot and
received after the receiver takes its snapshot.

<p>
From rule 2, and because messages are delivered in order,
messages sent in the past on
a channel are messages received before the marker on the channel.

<p>
So, the state of a channel is the sequence of
messages received along the channel after the receiver takes its
snapshot and before the receiver receives a marker along the channel.

<p>
Note: If an agent takes its local snapshot when it receives a marker
along a channel, then the snapshot of the channel is the empty
sequence of messages.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof that the Snapshot is an Intermediate State</p>
The slice at which the algorithm starts is earlier than the slice at
which local snapshots are taken, which in turn is earlier than the slice at
which the algorithm ends.

There
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
exists a computation from earlier to later slices
</a>
and so the global snapshot is an intermediate state between the points
at which the algorithm starts and ends.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Termination of the Algorithm</h5>

After any agent \(v\) initiates the algorithm, all agents that are
reachable from \(v\) will receive a marker and take their local
snapshots.

If every agent is reachable from an initiator then all agents take
local snapshots. 

<p>
Each agent takes its local snapshot at most once.

So, a marker is sent on a channel at most once.

The computation terminates when all markers are received.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Code Structure</h5>
The code outline is given below in Python.

<i>channels_recorded</i> is a dict (dictionary), where
<i>channels_recorded[sender]</i> becomes True when the snapshot for
the channel from this sender has finished being recorded.
<i>channel_snapshots</i> is a dict where
<i>channel_snapshots[sender]</i> is the ongoing recording of the
snapshot of the channel from the sender.

<pre>
taken_local_snapshot = False
channel_snapshots = {key: [] for key in predecessors}
channels_recorded = {key: False for key in predecessors}

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, Marker) and not taken_local_snapshot:
        local_snapshot = record_state()
        taken_local_snapshot = True
        channels_recorded[sender] = True
        output_message = Marker()
        for receiver in successors:
            send(output_message, receiver)
   elif isinstance(message, Marker) and taken_local_snapshot:
        channels_recorded[sender] = True
   else: 
        if taken_local_snapshot and not channels_recorded[sender]:
           channel_snapshots[sender] = \\ 
                       channel_snapshots[sender].append(message)
</pre>

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Applications of Global Snapshots</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<p>
<i>
Many algorithms are based on monitoring systems by taking repeated
  snapshots. 
</i>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Collecting Local Agent and Channel
Snapshots</p>

In some algorithms, agents send snapshots of their states and 
input channels to a collector agent which forms a global snapshot by
putting the information together.

In other algorithms agents carry
out distributed computations on local snapshots without using a collector.

We describe both types of algorithms in these pages.

<p>
Next we give a few examples of system monitoring.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Rollback and Recovery</p>

There exists a computation from the initial state of the computation
to a global snapshot.

So, when a transient error occurs, a rollback and recovery algorithm
restarts the computation at the most recent snapshot instead of restarting
it from the beginning.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Stable Properties</p>
If a stable property holds at any point in any computation then it
continues to hold forever in that computation.

For example, if a computation has deadlocked then it remains
deadlocked.

We discuss stable properties in detail later.

<p>
One way to detect stable properties is to monitor the system by
taking snapshots repeatedly.

For example, if a system deadlocks then all snapshots taken after the deadlock occurs
show that the system has deadlocked.

And, if a snapshot shows that the system is deadlocked then the system
is indeed deadlocked at that point.

<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 style="color:red;">Examples</h2>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
The remainder of this webpage consists of examples.

<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Snapshots may change a Client's Computation
</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
This example shows that the OS algorithm may change a client's
computation though it does not change the client's dataflow.

<p>
Figure 2 is a representation of a computation with event sequence
\([0, 1, 2, \ldots, ]\) and agents \(X, Y, Z\) without a concurrent OS
algorithm, and figure 3 shows how the OS changes this computation.

Events later in the computation are placed to the
right of earlier events.

    style="width:80%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.2: Representation of a Computation without Snapshots
</figcaption> 
</figure> 


<p>
Figure 3 shows how a client's computation is changed when the OS takes
snapshots. 

The local snapshots taken by agents are shown as a yellow
circle on the agents' timelines.

The OS delays event 3 so that it occurs after events 4, 5, 6, and 7,
as shown in the figure.

The OS changes the computation, but it does not change the dataflow.

<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.003.jpeg" alt="Fig2"
    style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: The OS changes a Client's Computation</figcaption>
</figure> 

In figure 3, the pre-snapshot events are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.

There is only one message received in a pre-snapshot
event, namely the message represented by the edge (0, 2).

So, every message received in a pre-snapshot event is sent in a
pre-snapshot event.

The figure shows that the set of pre-snapshot events is closed.


<!---------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Steps in a Global Snapshot
Algorithm: Initiation</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->

Figure 4 illustrates the first step of the algorithm.

    <figcaption>Fig.4: Agent Sends Markers when it Takes its Local
    Snapshot</figcaption> 
</figure>

Agent Y takes its local snapshot shown as a yellow vertex on Y's
timeline.

When Y takes its snapshot it sends markers on its output channels.

The markers are shown as green edges in the figure.


<p>
When agents X and Z each receive the markers, they take their local
snapshots because they haven't taken snapshots earlier.

<figure>

    style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.5: Agents Take Local Snapshots when they Receive Markers
</figcaption>
</figure>

The actions by X and Z of taking their snapshots are shown as yellow
vertices on their timelines in figure 5.


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Agents take Snapshots upon Receiving Markers</h4> 
<!--------------------------------------------------->
<p>
When X and Z take their snapshots they send markers out on their
output channels.

The markers sent by X are shown in figure 7.

The markers sent by Z are not shown in the figure.

<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.007.jpeg" alt="Fig6"
    style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.6: When an Agent takes its Snapshot it sends Markers.
    </figcaption>
</figure>



<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Snapshot of a Channel</h4> 
<!--------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Figure 8 shows how agent Y determines the state of the channel from X
to Y in the global snapshot.

Y starts recording the messages it receives along this channel after Y
takes its snapshot and stops the recording when it receives a marker
on this channel

The only message in this interval is the message corresponding to edge
(6, 7).


<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.008.jpeg" alt="Fig7"
    style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.7: Example: Recording a Channel State
</figcaption>
</figure> 

The message corresponding to edge \((0, 2)\) is from X to Y but is not
in the snapshot of 
the channel because both \(0\) and \(2\) are pre-snapshot events.

Likewise, the message corresponding to edge \((12, 13)\) is from X to
Y but is not in the snapshot of
the channel because both \(12\) and \(13\) are post-snapshot events.

The message corresponding to edge \((6, 7)\) was sent in a
pre-snapshot event and received in a post-snapshot event, and so it is
in the snapshot of the channel.
