<h1 class="w3-text-teal">A Global Snapshot Algorithm</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A global snapshot algorithm records a state of the system that can
  occur during a computation.

  The state obtained by the algorithm is called a global snapshot.

  Systems are monitored by taking repeated global snapshots.

  When a transient error is detected, a rollback and recovery
  algorithm restarts the computation from the most recent snapshot
  instead of starting it from the initial state.

  

  

  </p>
 
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Global Snapshot</h4> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  A global snapshot algorithm records a state of the system that
  occurs during a computation of the system.

  A state obtained by the algorithm is called a global snapshot.

  <p>
  A state of the system is a tuple with an element of the tuple for each agent and
  each channel.

  A system state is also called a global state to distinguish it from
  states of agents and states of channels.
  

  <p>
  An algorithm to record the state of a system is not instantaneous
  because the algorithm records the states of multiple agents and
  channels.

  The algorithm starts at some point and terminates at a later point.

  A global snapshot is a state that occurs in a computation from the
  state in which the algorithm starts to the state in which the algorithm ends.

  <p>
  The global snapshot algorithm is an example of an algorithm that is
  executed by a distributed operating system (OS) on behalf of a
  client.

  Next, we describe features of the OS that are relevant to the
  snapshot algorithm.

  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Distributed Operating System</h4>
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  
  
  Each client agent has an OS agent that supervises it.

  OS agents use the same processors and channels as clients do.
  
  OS agents can record, but not modify, states of their clients.
  
  OS agents can send and receive OS messages that are not seen
by clients.

<p>
Figure 1 is a representation of two OS agents that manage their
client agents.

Messages sent by a client are recorded by the OS and passed through
to destination clients.

The OS sends messages on the same channels as clients, but the OS
traps these messages so that the client does not see them.


<figure>
    <img src="ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1"
    style="width:60%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: OS and Clients use the same Channels</figcaption>
</figure> 

  <p>
  Execution of an OS agent on a processor may delay a client's
  steps on the same processor, and thus change the order in which the
  client's steps are executed. 

<i>The OS may change a client's computation -- the order of steps -- but
the OS must not change the client's dataflow.</i>
  
  <p>
  One way to record a global snapshot is for the OS to stop a client
  computation, then take a global snapshot, and then  restart the
client computation.

Our goal is to design an algorithm that does not stop the client.

<p>
Hereafter, when we refer to an agent we mean an OS agent.

Likewise, by messages we mean those that are sent and received by the
OS.


<p>
Next, let's develop OS agents and OS messages to record a global
snapshot.


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<p>
Let \(S_{init}\) and \(S_{fini}\) be the states in which the
algorithm starts and finishes, respectively.

Design an algorithm that records a state \(S^{*}\) such that
there exists a computation that starts at \(S_{init}\), then visits
\(S^{*}\) and then visits \(S_{fini}\).


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<p class="w3-text-teal">Strategy</p>
A general strategy for designing algorithms dealing with intermediate
states is to find a helpful <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
property of cuts</a>.

What property helps to determine \(S^{*}\)?

<p>
The property "Computations of Past before Future," given below, tells
us that \(S^{*}\) can be the state at any cut.

<!------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Computations of Past before Future.</p> 

<p>
Let computation \(X\) start in state \(S_{init}\) and end in state
\(S_{fini}\).

Let \(S^{*}\) be the state at a cut <code>(past, future)</code> of \(X\).

There exists a computation \(Y\) that starts in \(S_{init}\), visits
\(S^{*}\), and ends in \(S_{fini}\).

<p>
Using this strategy, our tasks reduce to (1) identifying a cut, and
(2) recording the state, \(S^{*}\), at the cut.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Identifying a Cut</h5>
Each agent has to record its own state because an agent's state is not
accessible to other agents.

The state of an agent that it records is called a <i>local snapshot</i>.

<p>
Define <code>past</code> as the set of steps at each agent before the
agent takes its local snapshot, and
define <code>future</code> as the set of steps at each agent after the
agent takes its local snapshot.
So, if a step \(x\) at an agent is in <code>past</code> then all steps
at that agent before \(x\) are also in <code>past</code>.

<p>
Let's use
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html"> the following property of
<code>past</code>, <code>future</code> and cuts:</a>
<p>
The partition <code>(past, future)</code> is a cut exactly when every
message received in <code>past</code> is sent in <code>past</code>.

<p>
Therefore, <code>(past, future)</code> is a cut exactly when:

<p style="color:blue;">Global Snapshot Rule</p>
<p style="color:blue;">
Each message received before the receiver takes its local snapshot
is sent before the sender takes its local snapshot.
<p>
<hr class="new2">

Design an algorithm yourself before reading further, and compare your
algorithm with the one given below.



<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

A special OS message called a <code>marker</code> is used to distinguish
pre-snapshot from post-snapshot messages.

Messages sent on a channel before a <code>marker</code> is sent on the
channel are messages sent in the <code>past</code> -- i.e. before the
sender takes its local snapshot -- and messages sent
after the marker are sent in the <code>future</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">The algorithm</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  The algorithm begins by one or more agents taking their local
  snapshots.
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent takes its local snapshot it sends a marker on each
  of its outgoing channels. 
  </li>
  <li>
  When an agent receives a marker, the agent takes its local snapshot
  if it has not already done so. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The snapshot of a channel is the sequence of messages received on
  the channel after the receiver takes its snapshot and before the
  receiver receives a marker on the channel.
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</h5>

<p>

From rule 3, each message received by an agent \(r\) on a channel
\(c\) before \(r\) takes its 
local snapshot is a message received by \(r\) before \(r\) receives a
marker on channel \(c\).

<p>
Because channels are first in first out, each message received by
 \(r\) on \(c\) before \(r\) receives a
marker on \(c\) is sent on \(c\) before a marker is
sent on \(c\).

<p>
From rule 2 each message sent on \(c\) before a marker is sent on
\(c\) is sent before the sender takes its local snapshot.

<p>
From the three paragraphs above it follows that the global snapshot
rule holds for the algorithm.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof about States of Channels</p>
The messages in a channel at the cut are the
messages sent in <code>past</code> and received in <code>future</code>.
These are messages sent before the sender takes its snapshot and
received after the receiver takes its snapshot.

So, the state of a channel is the sequence of
messages received along the channel after the receiver takes its
snapshot and before the receiver receives a marker along the channel.

<p>
Note: If an agent takes its local snapshot when it receives a marker
along a channel, then the snapshot of the channel is the empty
sequence of messages.

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Termination of the Algorithm</h5>

After any agent \(v\) initiates the algorithm, all agents that are
reachable from \(v\) will receive a marker and take their local
snapshots.

If every agent is reachable from an initiator then all agents take
local snapshots. 

<p>
Each agent takes its local snapshot at most once.

So, a marker is sent on a channel at most once.

The computation terminates when all markers are received.

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Collecting Local Snapshots to form Global
Snapshots</h5>
One way to collect local snapshots is to have an OS agent act as an
observer.

Each agent sends its local snapshots to the observer which puts the
local snapshots together to form the global snapshots.

Successive snapshots are disambiguated by using sequence numbers or
timestamps.

<p>
Some algorithms carry out distributed computations on local snapshots
without using an observer to collect local snapshots.

Later, we give examples of such algorithms.



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Applications of Global Snapshots</h3>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">System Monitoring</h4>
Systems can be monitored by taking global snapshots repeatedly.

Let \(S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, \) be the sequence of states
recorded by the system.

From the property
<a href="DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
Computations through Increasing Cuts
</a>
there exists a computation that visits each state \(S_{i}\) in order
of increasing \(i\).

The system monitor checks the sequence of snapshots to determine if
some action is required.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Rollback and Recover</h4>


Let \(S^{*}\) be the most recent snapshot recorded by a system monitor.

From the property,
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
"Computations of Past before Future"</a>
there exists a computation that starts at the initial state and later
visits \(S^{*}\).

So, if an error is detected in a computation then the computation can be
restarted from \(S^{*}\) rather than rolling all the way back to the
initial state. 



<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Stable Predicates</h4>

A <i>stable predicate</i> is a predicate with the following property: If the
predicate holds at any point in any computation then it continues to
hold forever thereafter in that computation. Equivalently, if a stable
predicate holds in a state \(s\) then it holds in all states reachable
from \(s\).

<p>
Examples of stable predicates are: "The computation has
terminated," and "The computation is deadlocked."

If a computation has terminated at some point then it remains 
terminated.

Likewise if a computation has deadlocked then it remains deadlocked.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Specification of Detection Algorithms</h5>
An algorithm to detect a stable property \(P\) has the following
specification.
<ol>
  <li>
  If \(P\) holds when the algorithm is initiated then the algorithm
  detects that \(P\) holds.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the algorithm detects that \(P\) holds then \(P\) holds when the
  algorithm terminates.
  </li>
</ol>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">General Detection Algorithms</h5>
A general solution is for the operating system to monitor a client
computation by taking repeated snapshots of the computation.

The OS checks whether a specified stable property holds in each
snapshot.

From the property,
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
"Computations of Past before Future"</a>
this general solution satisfies the specification of detection
algorithms. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">Detection with Observers</p>
The OS uses an agent, the observer, to collect local snapshots and
form a global snapshot.

The observer inspects the global snapshot to determine if the property
holds in the snapshot.


The OS can also use multiple observers each of which collects
local information from subnetworks; the OS then carries out a
distributed algorithm on its collection of observers.

<p>
The OS can also execute a distributed algorithm on local
snapshots without having observers collect local information, as
described next.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Detection without Observers: Distributed
Algorithms on Local Snapshots</p>

Distributed algorithms on local snapshots operate in two phases.

In the first phase a global snapshot algorithm is executed.

The local snapshot of each agent and its incoming channels are stored
locally, at the agent, without sending the information to observers.

<p>
In the second phase a distributed algorithm is executed to determine
if the local information stored at agents satisfies a specified global
property, such as "computation has deadlocked."

The algorithm in the second phase operates on unchanging data.

These algorithms are often distributed graph algorithms.


<p>
The two phases can be executed concurrently in many applications.
