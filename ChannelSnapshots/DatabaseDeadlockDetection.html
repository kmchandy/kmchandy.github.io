  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Database Deadlocks</h2>

  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A database deadlock occurs when the system has a cycle of agents
  where each agent in the cycle remains waiting forever for a
  resource held and required by the next agent in the cycle.

  A database deadlock detection algorithm is executed by the operating
  system to determine whether there exists a cycle of deadlocked agents.

  Detection algorithms are based on global snapshots.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>

  <p>
  Agents in a system share a set of files.
  A file can be accessed by at most one agent at a time.
    <p>
    An agent \(u\) is in one of the following states:
    <ol>
      <li>
      State 1: Executing without holding shared files. It may remain in this
  state for ever or it transits to state 2.
      </li>
      <li>
      State 2: Waiting to acquire a nonempty set \(u.needs\) of
      shared files. The agent remains in this state until it holds all
  the files in \(u.needs\) at which point in transits to state 3.
      </li>
      <li>
      State 3: Executing while holding all files in
      \(u.needs\). It remains in this state for only finite time after
  which it transits to state 1.
      </li>
    </ol>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock</h3>
A cycle of waiting agents is in a deadlock if each agent in the cycle is waiting to
acquire a file that is held and needed by the next agent in the cycle.

    <h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    In the example, a file is identified by its color.
A system has one red, one blue and one green file.
Agents \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) are deadlocked in the following state.
    Agent \(x\) needs the red and blue file; it is
holding the red file and is waiting
    to acquire the blue file,

    Agent \(y\) needs the blue and green files; it holds the blue file and is waiting
    to acquire the green file.

    Agent \(z\) needs the green and red files; it holds the green file and is waiting
    to acquire the red file.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Use the General Method for Detecting Stable
Properties</h4>
The obvious way to design an algorithm to detect a stable property is
    to use the general method for detecting stable properties: 
monitor a system by taking repeated snapshots.
The algorithm detects deadlock if a global snapshot is a deadlocked state.

See
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
Global Snapshots
</a>
and
<a href="LogicalClocks.html">
Logical Clocks
    </a> for ways to take repeated snapshots.

    <p>

    The general method for detecting stable properties has two phases: (1)
    obtain a global snapshot, and (2) analyze the global snapshot.

The first phase reduces the analysis of a dynamic system  -- in which states
    of agents are changing, and messages are being sent and received -- into the analysis
of a static structure.

Analyzing a static graph to determine if there is a cycle of
deadlocked agents is straightforward.

<p>
Agents can send data to a collector agent which detects whether there
is a cycle of waiting agents in the graph.

Alternatively, agents can analyze the graph using a distributed
algorithm without sending data to a single collector.

Let's look at both methods.


    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">
    Algorithm in which Agents send Local Snapshots to a Collector.
    </h5>

The
<a href="TerminationDetection.html">
termination detection algorithm
</a> is an example of an algorithm in which a collector collates data
from agents.
Let's modify the termination detection algorithm to detect a
deadlocked cycle.

<p>
Each agent sends its state to a <i>collector agent</i> when the agent starts to wait.
The collector keeps the latest message that it receives from an agent
and discards all the earlier ones from that agent.

If there is a deadlock based on the messages that the collector has received,
then the system is deadlocked.

<p>
The proof of correctness of the algorithm is similar to that for
termination detection. 
    



     <h5 class="w3-text-teal">
    Distributed Algorithm that Detects Cycles in Graphs
    </h5>

<p>
Algorithms that use global snapshots operate in two phases: (1)
    obtain a global snapshot, and (2) analyze the static structure of
a global snapshot.
For deadlock detection, the
problem is to detect cycles in a (static) graph obtained by
the snapshot.

    Next, we describe an algorithm that combines the two phases of the
global snapshot algorithm into a single phase.



<p>
The algorithm is a modification of 
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">the global snapshot algorithm</a> where 
markers play two roles: record a snapshot and determine
whether there is a cycle of waiting agents in the snapshot state.

We begin by describing a straightforward distributed algorithm by
which any agent \(u\) determines if it is part of a cycle.

Then we combine this algorithm with the marker algorithm for taking
global snapshots.


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">
A Distributed Algorithm to Determine if an Agent is in a Cycle
</h5>
Let's design an algorithm by which an agent \(u\) determines if it is
part of a cycle.

The algorithm uses messages where every message is a path in the
graph.

A path is represented by a list of vertices.

<p>
The initiator \(u\) sends a message \([u]\) -- a list consisting of
the single element \(u\) on each of its output channels.

This message represents a path of zero hops starting at \(u\).

<p>

The algorithm for an agent other than the receiver is given below.

When an agent receives a message it sends messages on its output
channels if it has not already done so.

<p>
A message is a list of vertices that represents a cycle-free path from the
initiator.

When an agent \(w\) gets a message \([u, \ldots, v]\) it sends the
message \([u, \ldots, v, w]\) on each of its output channels.

<pre>
finished = False

start()
def receive(path, sender):
   if not finished:
       path.append(my_id)
       for receiver in successor_list:
           send(path, receiver)
       finished = True
</pre>



<p>
If the initiator receives a message, then the initiator is part of the
cycle given by the list of vertices in the message.

The algorithm for the initiator is given below.

<pre>
finished = False
path = [my_id]
for receiver in successor_list:
   send(path, receiver)

start()
def receive(path, sender):
   if not finished:
      path.append(my_id)
      print(path)
      finished = True
</pre>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Combining Cycle Detection and Snapshot
Algorithms</h5>

Associated with each agent \(v\) is a set of files <i>v.needs</i> that
\(v\) needs to execute and a set of files <i>v.holds</i> that \(v\)
has.

The set of files that \(v\) needs to continue executing is
<i>v.waits</i> which is the set that \(v\) needs but does not
hold. 

An agent is in the waiting state when <i>v.waits</i> is not empty, and
transits to the next state -- executing with shared files -- 
when <i>v.waits</i> becomes empty.

<p>
A marker <i>m</i> has fields <i>m.waits</i> and <i>m.path</i> where <i>m.path</i>
plays the same role as a message in the algorithm to detect cycles --
<i>m.path</i> is a path of waiting agents. 


When an agent \(v\) sends a
marker \(m\) it sets \(m.waits\) to <i>v.waits</i>.

<p>
Any waiting agent initiates the
algorithm by sending markers on its output channels.

When an agent, other than the initiator, receives a message it carries
out the following steps.

The agent participates in the snapshot algorithm at most once, and the
variable <i>finished</i> indicates whether it has already
participated.

<p>
If the agent receives a marker while it is waiting and has not
finished it sends markers on its output channels.

The <i>waits</i> field of the marker is the set of resources that the
agent is waiting for.

</p>
<pre>
finished = False

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   waits = needs - holds
   waiting = (waits != {})
   if message.isinstance(Marker) and waiting and not finished:
      if message.waits & holds & needs:
         extended_path = message.path.append(my_id)
         new_message = Marker(waits, extended_path)
         for receiver in successors:
            send(new_message, receiver)
</pre>
   

The initiator detects the existence of a deadlocked cycle if the
initiator is waiting when it receives a marker \(m\) and there
is a file in \(m.waits\) that the initiator holds and needs.



<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof of correctness</p>
The algorithm is essentially the same as the global snapshot
algorithm, and the proof follows directly from the proof of the
snapshot algorithm. 


<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
The example shows the deadlock detection algorithm for the cycle of
waiting processes shown in figure 2.

<p>
Agent \(x\) initiates the algorithm when \(x\) is waiting
by sending a marker \(m\) where
\(m.waits\) is the set consisting of the blue file.

<p>
When \(y\) receives the message, \(y\) is waiting and
\(y\) is holding a file that is in \(m.waits\) and that \(y\) needs; so,
\(y\) sends markers \(m'\) with a waits field that contains the green
file.

<p>
When \(z\) receives \(m'\), \(z\) is waiting, and
\(z\) is holding a file that is in \(m'.waits\) and that \(z\) needs;
so \(z\) sends markers \(m''\) with a waits field that has the red
file.

<p>
When \(x\) receives \(m''\), \(x\) detects deadlock because \(x\) is
waiting and there is a file in the \(m''.waits\) that
\(x\) holds and needs.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Optimization</p>
File managers keep track of which agent holds a given file.
So, an agent waiting for a file sends markers only to the agent
holding that file instead of sending markers to all agents.
