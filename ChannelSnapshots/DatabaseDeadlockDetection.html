  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Database Deadlocks</h2>

  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A database deadlock occurs when the system has a cycle of agents
  where each agent in the cycle remains waiting forever for a
  resource held and required by the next agent in the cycle.

  A database deadlock detection algorithm is executed by the operating
  system to determine whether there exists a cycle of deadlocked agents.

  Detection algorithms are based on global snapshots.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>

  <p>
  Agents in a system share a set of files.
  A file can be accessed by at most one agent at a time.
    <p>
    An agent \(u\) is in one of the following states:
    <ol>
      <li>
      State 1: Executing without holding shared files. It may remain in this
  state for ever or it transits to state 2.
      </li>
      <li>
      State 2: Waiting to acquire a nonempty set \(u.needs\) of
      shared files. The agent remains in this state until it holds all
  the files in \(u.needs\) at which point in transits to state 3.
      </li>
      <li>
      State 3: Executing while holding all files in
      \(u.needs\). It remains in this state for only finite time after
  which it transits to state 1.
      </li>
    </ol>

    </figure>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock</h3>
A cycle of waiting agents is in a deadlock if each agent in the cycle is waiting to
acquire a file that is held and needed by the next agent in the cycle.

    <h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    In the example, a file is identified by its color.
A system has one red, one blue and one green file.
Agents \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) are deadlocked in the following state.
    Agent \(x\) needs the red and blue file; it is
holding the red file and is waiting
    to acquire the blue file,

    Agent \(y\) needs the blue and green files; it holds the blue file and is waiting
    to acquire the green file.

    Agent \(z\) needs the green and red files; it holds the green file and is waiting
    to acquire the red file.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The General Method</h4>
The general method for detecting stable properties is by
monitoring a system by taking repeated snapshots.
See
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
Global Snapshots
</a>
,
<a href="LogicalClocks.html">
Logical Clocks
    </a>
    and
<a href="TerminationDetection.html">
Termination Detection
    </a>.
    

The general method for detecting stable properties has two phases: (1)
    obtain a global snapshot, and (2) analyze the global snapshot.

    <p>
The first phase reduces the analysis of a dynamic system  -- in which states
    of agents are changing, and messages are being appended and
    removed from channels -- into the analysis
of a single state.

    This page describes an algorithm that combines the two phases into
    a single phase.

The algorithm is the
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">global snapshot</a> where 
markers play two concurrent roles: record a snapshot and determine
where the system is deadlocked in the snapshot state.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Modified Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Core Idea of the Algorithm</h5>
A marker \(m\) has a field \(m.waits\).

When a waiting agent \(u\) sends a
marker \(m\) it sets \(m.waits\) to the set of files that \(u\)
has to acquire to execute -- these are files that \(u\) needs and
does not hold.

<p>
Any one agent initiates the
algorithm. Marker propagation uses the following rule:
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
When a waiting agent receives a marker \(m\), the agent sends markers if and
only if
there is a file in \(m.waits\) that the agent holds and needs.
</p>
<hr class="new2">
A cycle is deadlocked if a marker is propagated around the cycle, and
reaches the initiator.

<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
Agent \(x\) initiates the algorithm by sending a marker \(m\) where
\(m.waits\) is the set consisting of the blue file.
When \(y\) receives the message it is waiting and
it is holding a file that is in \(m.waits\) and that \(y\) needs; so,
\(y\) sends markers \(m'\) with a waits field that contains the green file.
When \(z\) receives \(m'\), \(z\) sends markers \(m''\) with a
waits field that has the red file.
When \(x\) receives \(m''\), \(x\) detects deadlock because
there is a file in the \(m''.waits\) that
\(x\) holds and needs.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Optimization</h5>
File managers keep track of which agent holds a given file.
So, an agent waiting for a file sends markers only to the agent
holding that file instead of sending markers to all agents.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm Details</h5>

Let \(u.holds\) be the set of files that a waiting agent \(u\)
holds.

Then 

    <p>
    \(
    u.waits = \{x | (x \in u.needs) \wedge (x \notin u.holds)\}
\)

    <p>
A cycle of agents is deadlocked if for every edge \(u, v\) in the cycle
    \(u.waits \cap v.needs \cap v.holds\) is not empty.



<p class="w3-text-teal">Initiating the Algorithm</p>

A waiting agent
 initiates the algorithm by sending a <i>marker</i> message on
each of its outgoing channels. Assume that there is only one
initiator.

(Multiple initiators can be handled by tagging messages with the
identity of the initiator.)

<p>
A marker \(m\) has a field \(m.waits\).

When an agent \(w\) sends a marker \(m\) the agent sets \(m.waits\) to
\(w.waits\). 

<p class="w3-text-teal">Propagating Markers</p>
When \(v\) receives a marker \(m\), if 
\(m.waits \cap v.needs \cap v.holds\) is not empty
then \(v\) sends a marker \(m'\) on each of its outgoing channels where 
\(m'.waits\) is \(v.waits\).



<p class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</p>
When the initiator \(u\) receives a marker \(m\), the initiator
detects that it is in a deadlocked cycle if 
\(m.waits \cap u.needs \cap u.holds\) is not empty.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Correctnes of the Algorithm</p>
The algorithm is the global snapshot algorithm which was
proved earlier.
