  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Database Deadlocks</h2>
  
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>

  <p>
  Agents in a system share a set of files.
    Each shared file is represented as an
    indivisible colored token, with each file having its own
    unique color. The system has at most one token of a given color.

    Tokens can be sent from agent to agent. Tokens are not duplicated
    or destroyed.

    <p>
    An agent \(u\) is in one of the following states:
    <ol>
      <li>
      Executing without holding shared files.
      </li>
      <li>
      Waiting to acquire a set \(u.needs\) of
      shared files. 
      </li>
      <li>
      Executing while holding all files in
      \(u.needs\).
      </li>
    </ol>


    
    
    <figure>
    <img
    src="DatabaseDeadlockDetection/DatabaseDeadlockDetection.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The Life Cycle of an Agent</figcaption>
    </figure>
    An agent executes, while holding shared files, for only a finite
    time.
    An agent may execute without holding shared files forever.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock</h3>
A cycle of waiting agents is in a deadlock if each agent is waiting to
acquire a token held by the next agent in the cycle. Our task is to
design an algorithm by which an agent detects if it is part of a
deadlocked cycle.

<h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
A system has one red, one blue and one green token.
Agents \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) are deadlocked in the following state.
    Agent \(x\) needs the red and blue token; it is
holding the red token and is waiting
    to acquire a blue token,

    Agent \(y\) needs the blue and green tokens; it holds the blue token and is waiting
    to acquire the green token.

    Agent \(z\) needs the green and red tokens; it holds the green token and is waiting
    to acquire the red token.

    alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
  <figcaption>Fig.2 - An Example of a Deadlock</figcaption>
</figure>

    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock Specification</h5>

    
    <p>
    A cycle of agents is deadlocked exactly when each agent in the
    cycle is waiting to get a token that is held and needed by the next
    agent in the cycle.

    <p>
    Let \(u.holds\) be the set of tokens that \(u\) holds. \(u\) is
    waiting to get tokens in \(u.waits\), the set of tokens that it
    needs but does not hold.
    <p>
    \(
    u.waits = \{x | (x \in u.needs) \wedge (x \notin u.holds)\}
    \)
    
    <p>
    A cycle of agents is deadlocked exactly when for every edge \(u,
    v\) in the cycle:
    \(u.waits \cap v.needs \cap v.holds\) is not empty.


    
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The General Method</h4>
The general method for detecting stable properties is by
monitoring a system by taking repeated snapshots.
See
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
Global Snapshots
</a>
and
<a href="LogicalClocks.html">
Logical Clocks
</a>.


The general method for detecting stable properties has two phases (1)
    obtain a global snapshot, and (2) analyze the global snapshot.

The first phase reduces analysis of a dynamic system into the analysis
of static snapshot.

The second phase analyzes <i>static</i> date structures such as phase.

<p>
    This page describes an algorithm consisting of a single phase
that is an optimization of the two-phase algorithm.

The algorithm is the global snapshot with marker messages where the
markers play two roles concurrently: detect snapshots and compute
properties of snapshots.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Modified Global Snapshot Algorithm</h4>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Initiating the Algorithm</p> A waiting agent
\(u\) initiates the algorithm by sending a <i>marker</i> message on
each of its outgoing channels. Assume that there is only one
initiator.

(Multiple initiators can be handled by tagging messages with the
identity of the initiator.)

<p>
A marker \(m\) has a field \(m.waits\).

When an agent \(w\) sends a marker \(m\) the agent sets \(m.waits\) to
\(w.waits\). 

<p class="w3-text-teal">Propagating Markers</p>
When \(v\) receives a marker \(m\), if \(v\) hasn't already
sent markers and
<br>
\(m.waits \cap v.needs \cap v.holds\) is not empty
<br>
then \(v\) sends a marker \(m'\) on each of its outgoing channels where 
\(m'.waits\) is \(v.waits\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</p>
When the initiator \(u\) receives a marker \(m\), the initiator
detects that it is in a deadlocked cycle if 
\(m.waits \cap u.needs \cap u.holds\) is not empty.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Correctnes of the Algorithm</p>
The algorithm is the global snapshot algorithm which was
proved earlier.
