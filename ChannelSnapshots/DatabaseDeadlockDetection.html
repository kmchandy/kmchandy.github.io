<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock Detection</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-green">

  Global Snapshots and State Detection.</a>
  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  <i>Central Ideas</i>:
  The set of states in which a deadlocked cycle of agents exists is a
  stable set: if a cycle of agents is deadlocked at any point then
  that cycle of agents remains deadlocked forever thereafter.
  Deadlock detection is an example of termination detection.
  Detection algorithms are based on consistent cuts, global snapshots
  and system monitoring.
  </p>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Definition</h2>
  
  <p>
  Agents in a system share resources such as files.
  Agents don't release the
  resources that they hold until they get all the resources they need.
  A cycle of agents
  is deadlocked when each agent in the cycle needs a resource held
  by the next agent in the cycle.

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <h4  style="color:red;">Example of a Deadlocked Cycle</h4>
  In this example, a resource is a token of a specific color.
  A system has exactly one token of each of the following colors: red,
  blue, and green.
  Agents \(u\), \(v\) and \(w\) are deadlocked in the following state.
  <ol>
    <li>
    \(u\) continues to hold the red token until it receives the blue token.
    </li>
    <li>
    \(v\) continues to hold the blue token until it receives the green token.
    </li>
    <li>
    \(w\) continues to hold the green token until it receives the red token.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Variables of an Agent</p>
  An agent \(A\) is in a deadlocked cycle only if it continues to hold
  a nonempty set \(A_{holds}\) of resources until it acquires all the
  resources in a  nonempty set \(A_{needs}\) of resources. In the
  example, \(u_{holds} = \{red\}\), and \(u_{needs} = \{blue\}\). 

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">The problem</h5>
    The problem is to develop an algorithm that detects if there exists
    a cycle of deadlocked agents,
The detection algorithm may use messages and agents that are not part of the
  underlying computation.
  The detection algorithm must not modify the underlying computation.
  The algorithm has a boolean variable \(B\) which is initially
    \(False\) and  becomes \(True\) if and when the
  detection algorithm detects a cycle of deadlocked agents.

  <p>
  The algorithm can be extended to output the identitites of the
  agents in a deadlocked cycle. We
  leave the extension to the reader.

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Deadlock Detection: Specification</h4>

  The specification of an algorithm that detects that the system state
  of a computation is in a stable set \(P\) is repeated here, for
  convenience.
  
<hr class="new2">
<h6 style="color:blue;">
<ol>
  <li>
  If at any point in a computation the system state is in \(P\) then
  there is a point in the computation after which \(B\) remains True.
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(B = True\) at any point in a computation then the system state
  at that point is in \(P\).
  </li>
</ol>
</h6>
<hr class="new2">
For the specific application of deadlock detection, \(P\) is the
set of states in which there exists a deadlocked cycle of agents.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The General Method applied to Termination
Detection</h3>
<a
  href="ChannelSnapshots.html">System monitoring</a> can be used to
detect every stable property including deadlock.
Each agent send its local
snapshot at time \(T\) to an agent, which we call a <i>detector</i>.
The detector puts together local snapshots at \(T\) to get the global
snapshot at \(T\).
The detector obtains global snapshots repeatedly for
increasing values of \(T\).
Initially, \(B\) is False and the detector sets \(B\) to True if
the global snapshot at \(T\), for any \(T\), shows a deadlocked cycle
of agents.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Deadlock
Detection without Scheduling Snapshots</h3>

Next, let's design an algorithm for deadlock detection by
modifying the marker algorithm for global snapshots.
Multiple agents may initiate snapshot algorithms and 
an agent may initiate multiple snapshot algorithms.
Snapshot algorithms initiated by different agents, or initiated
multiple times by the same agent, can be distinguished from each other
by tagging markers with the identities of the
initiators and sequence numbers.  In the following, we restrict attention to one
snapshot algorithm initiated by a single agent.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">A Modified Snapshot Algorithm</h5>
We modify the marker message in the snapshot algorithm as follows.
A marker message has a field, \(needs\), which is the
set of resources that the sender of the message needs.
The variable \(B\) which signals
that deadlock has been detected is initially False and is set to True
by the initiator when the initiator detects deadlock and then remains
True thereafter.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for the Initiator</h5>
The algorithm for an initiator of the snapshot is as follows.
Let the initiator be agent \(X\). 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Initiation</i>: Agent \(X\) initiates the detection algorithm when
  \(X_{holds}\) and \(X_{needs}\) are both nonempty. It initiates the
  algorithm by by broadcasting marker messages \(M\) with \(M_{needs} = X_{needs}\) to
  all other agents.  
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Detection</i>: When the initiator receives a marker message \(P\) the initiator
  detects deadlock if it holds a requested resource, i.e.,
  \(X_{holds} \cap P_{needs}\) is nonempty.
  </li>
</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Agents other than the Initiator</h5>
When an agent \(Y\), other than the initiator, receives a marker \(Q\),
the agent takes the following action. If the agent has not already
sent markers, and the agent needs resources and holds a needed
resource (i.e., \(Y_{needs}\) and \(Y_{holds} \cap Q_{needs}\) are both
nonempty), then the agent broadcasts markers \(R\) with \(R_{needs} =
Y_{needs}\).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4  style="color:red;">Example of the Modified Snapshot Algorithm</h4>
Let's look at the deadlock detection algorithm with agent \(u\) as the
initiator for the system described earlier.
<ol>
  <li>
  \(u\) initiates the algorithm by sending marker messages \(M\) with a needs field of {blue}.
  </li>
  <li>
  When \(v\) receives \(M\) it sends marker messages \(M1\) with a needs field of {green}.
  </li>
  <li>
  When \(w\) receives \(M1\) it sends marker messages \(M2\) with a needs field of {red}.
  </li>
  <li>
  When \(u\) receives \(M2\) it detects deadlock.
  </li>
</ol>




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h4>

The algorithm is the same as the marker algorithm for global snapshots
with additional information in the markers.

The agent states that are recorded are part of a global snapshot. The
proof of correctness of this modified marker algorithm follows from
the proof of the marker algorithm.
