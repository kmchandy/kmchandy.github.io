<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A distributed computation has terminated when all agents are idle
  and all channels are empty.

  A termination detection algorithm is executed by the operating
  system to determine whether a client computation has terminated.

  Detection algorithms are based on global snapshots.
  </p>
  
  


  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Definition</h3>
  
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Review of Agents and Termination of Computation</h4>
  We
  <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Basics.html">
  described agents earlier.
  </a>
  We give a summary of that description next.

  <p>
    An agent is either <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. An idle agent
    remains idle until it receives a message at which point it becomes
active. An idle agent does not send messages.

An active agent may send messages. An active agent
may become idle at any point.

<p>
  A computation terminates in states in which all agents
  are idle and all channels are empty.

  A channel \(C\) is empty exactly when \(\; C_{s} = C_{r}\), where
  \(C_{s}, C_{r}\) are the numbers of messages 
  sent and received (respectively) on \(C\).

  So,

  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
  A computation is in a terminated state exactly
  when all agents are idle and
  for all channels \(C\),  \(\; C_{s} = C_{r}\).
  </p>
  <hr class="new2">
  

  <p>
  Termination is stable -- if a computation has terminated then it
  remains terminated.

  Termination detection is an example of detection of stable properties.



  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Detection of Stable Properties: Specification</h3>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  The problem is to develop an operating system algorithm that
  detects whether a stable property holds in a client's computation.
  In this example the stable property to be detected is termination.
  
  See <a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">Global Snapshots</a> for a
  description of OS algorithms.

  <p>
  The detection algorithm has a boolean variable \(detected\) which is
  initially \(False\) and becomes
  \(True\) if and when the algorithm detects that the specified stable
property holds.

The specification of an algorithm to detect a stable property is as follows.
  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr class="new2">
<h6 style="color:blue;">
<ol>
  <li>
  If the stable property holds at a point \(t\) then \(detected\)
  becomes \(True\)  at or after \(t\). 
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(detected\) is \(True\) at any point then the stable property holds at that point.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem?</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Use the General Method for Detecting Stable
Properties</h6>
The obvious way to detect stable properties is to use the general method:
monitor a system by taking repeated snapshots.
\(detected\) becomes \(True\) if and when a snapshot shows that the stable
predicate holds.

See
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
Global Snapshots
</a>
and
<a href="LogicalClocks.html">
Logical Clocks
</a> for ways to take repeated snapshots. 


<h6 class="w3-text-teal">
An Alternate Method for Detecting Termination
</h6>
Next we describe another algorithm which is
straightforward application of.
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
the Theorem about Past and Future</a>.

From the theorem, a slice is is closed if:
For all channels \(C\),  \(\; C_{s} \geq C_{r}\), where \(C_{s}, C_{r}\)
  are the numbers of messages 
  sent and received (respectively) on the channel in the past
  events.

<p>
So, <i>all</i> slices in which all agents are idle and for all channels
\(C\),  \(\; C_{s} = C_{r}\), are closed.

This insight suggests the following algorithm.

<p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Termination Detection Algorithm</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
The algorithm uses an agent, that we call <i>the detector</i> which is
part of the operating system.

Let  \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\) be the numbers of messages sent and
received (respectively) on channel \(C\),.

<p>
Each time an agent transits from active to idle it sends a message to
the detector.

This message contains \(C_{s}\)
for each of that agent's outgoing channels \(C\),
and \(C_{r}\) for each of the agent's incoming channels \(C\).

<p>
The detector keeps only the latest message that it receives from each
agent.
Let \(C_{s}^{*}, C_{r}^{*}\) be the last value of \(C_{s}, C_{r}\)
(respectively) that the detector has received.

<p class="w3-text-teal">The Detection Condition</p>
<p style="color:blue;">
The detector detects that computation has terminated if it has
received at least one message from each agent and for
all channels \(C\): \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).
</p>



<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
Proof of part 1 -- If the computation terminates, then after the
computation terminates the detection condition holds.
<p>
The set of the last messages sent by agents before they remains idle forever
has the property \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\) for all channels \(C\).


<p>
Proof of part 2 -- If the
detection condition holds then computation has terminated.

<p>
If that the detection condition holds 

then agents sent messages to the detector with the values \(C_{s}^{*}
= C_{r}^{*}\).

The slice of points at which these messages are sent is closed.

So, the state at the slice -- computation has terminated -- is a state
in the computation.
