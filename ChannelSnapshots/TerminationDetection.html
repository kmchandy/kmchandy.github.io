<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A distributed computation has terminated when all agents are idle
  and all channels are empty.

  A termination detection algorithm is executed by the operating
  system to determine whether a client computation has terminated.

  Detection algorithms are based on global snapshots.
  </p>
  
  


  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Definition</h3>
  
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Review of Agents</h4>
  We
  <a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Basics.html">
  described agents earlier.
  </a>
  We give a summary of that description next.

  <p>
    An agent is either <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. An idle agent
    remains idle until it receives a message at which point it becomes
active. An idle agent does not send messages.

An active agent may send messages. An active agent
may become idle at any point.

<p>
  A computation terminates in states in which all agents
  are idle and all channels are empty.
  The set of states in which computation has terminated is a stable
  set -- if a computation has terminated then it remains terminated.



  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Detection of Stable Properties: Specification</h3>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  The problem is to develop an operating system algorithm that
  detects whether a stable property holds in the client's computation;
  in this example the stable property is termination.
  
  See <a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">Global Snapshots</a> for a
  description of OS algorithms.

  <p>
  The detection algorithm has a boolean variable \(B\) which is
  initially \(False\) and becomes
  \(True\) if and when the algorithm detects that the specified stable
  property holds.

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr class="new2">
<h6 style="color:blue;">
<ol>
  <li>
  If the stable property holds at a point \(t\) then \(B\)
  becomes \(True\)  at or after \(t\). 
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(B\) is \(True\) at any point then the stable property holds at that point.
  </li>
</ol>
</h6>
<hr class="new2">

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------->


The general method for detecting stable properties is by
monitoring a system by taking repeated snapshots.

\(B\) becomes \(True\) if and when a snapshot shows that the stable
predicate holds.

See
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
Global Snapshots
</a>
and
<a href="LogicalClocks.html">
Logical Clocks
</a>.

Next we describe an algorithm for the specific case of
termination detection.

This algorithm is a direct application of the global snapshot theorem.

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Termination Detection Algorithm</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

The algorithm is a 
straightforward application of.
<a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">the Global Snapshot Theorem</a>.



<p>
The algorithm uses an agent, that we call <i>the detector</i> which is
part of the operating system.

Each time an agent transits from active to idle it sends \(C_{s}\)
for each of its outgoing channels \(C\),
and \(C_{r}\) for each of its incoming channels \(C\), to the
detector.

<p>
The detector keeps only the latest message that it receives from each
agent.
Let \(C_{s}^{*}, C_{r}^{*}\) be the last value of \(C_{s}, C_{r}\)
(respectively) that the detector has received.

<p class="w3-text-teal">The Detection Condition</p>
<p style="color:blue;">
The detector detects that computation has terminated if it has
received a message from each agent and for
all channels \(C\): \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).
</p>



<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
Each agent takes its local snapshot when it sends a message to the
detector.

In this snapshot the agent is idle and the numbers of messages sent
and received on a channel \(C\) incident on the agent is \(C_{s},
C_{r}\) respectively.

<p>
The global snapshot theorem says that the local snapshots form a
global snapshot if, for all channels \(C\): \(C_{s} \geq C_{r}\).

This condition holds if \(C_{s} = C_{r}\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">
Proof of part 1 of the specification
</p>

Let \(C_{s}^{*}, C_{r}^{*}\) be the number of messages sent and
received (respectively) by an agent with incident
 channel \(C\) when the agent transits from active to idle for
the  last time before the computation terminates.

<p>
The last messages received by the detector from agents
have the property, \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\), and
when the detector receives these messages it sets \(B\) to \(True\).


<p class="w3-text-teal">
Proof of part 2 of the specification
</p>

Let \(T\) be the point at which the detector determines that the
client computation has terminated.
Then at \(T\), for all channels \(C\), \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).

<p>
So, for each agent \(A\), there is a point \(t_{A}\), earlier than \(T\), at which \(A\) sent
\(C_{s}^{*}\) for each of its output channels \(C\), and 
\(C_{r}^{*}\) for each of its input channels \(C\), to the detector.
Point \(t_{A}\) is the point of the local snapshot of \(A\).

<p>
From the global snapshot theorem, because \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\) for all channels,
the set of local snapshots forms a global snapshot.

The computation has terminated in this global snapshot -- all agents
are idle and all channels are empty.
