<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A distributed computation has terminated when all agents are idle
  and all channels are empty.

  A termination detection algorithm is executed by the operating
  system to determine whether a client computation has terminated.

  </p>
  
  


  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Definition</h3>
<p>
  A computation terminates in states in which all
  channels are empty and all agents are waiting to receive messages.

  An agent is said to be <i>active</i> while it is processing a
  message and <i>idle</i> while it is waiting to process a message.

  A terminated state is one in which all agents are idle and all
  channels are empty.

  <p>
  Let \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\) be the numbers of messages 
  sent and received (respectively) on channel \(C\).

  A computation is in a terminated state exactly
  when:
  <ol>
    <li>
    All agents are idle and
    </li>
    <li>
    for all channels \(C\):  \(\; C_{s} = C_{r}\).
    </li>
  </ol>

  The problem is to design an algorithm that detects whether the
  computation is in a terminated state.
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve the Problem?</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Strategy</p>

  A strategy to solve detection problems is to start with the
  <a href="ChannelSnapshots.html">general detection algorithm</a> and
  then explore optimizations by using
  <a href="DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
  properties of cuts.</a>
  
  Let's explore optimizations.

  <p>
  The algorithm detects whether a channel is empty and it can do so
  given the numbers of messages sent and received on the channel
  without information about message contents.

  What <a href="DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
  properties of cuts</a>
  come to mind to help us design an algorithm based on message counts?

  <p>
  We use
  <a href="DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
  "Cut based on Counts of Messages Sent and Received,"</a>
  which is given again below.

<p>
There exists a cut <code>(past, future)</code> exactly when the
following two conditions hold:

<ol>
  <li>
  For all \(C\):  \(\; C_{s} \geq C_{r}\),
  <p>
  where
  \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\) are the numbers of messages sent and
  received, respectively, on channel \(C\), in <code>past</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  If a step \(x\) of an agent is in <code>past</code> then steps at
  that agent before \(x\) are also in <code>past</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

The property suggests the following algorithm.



  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Termination Detection Algorithm</h4>

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Agent Actions</p>
  When an agent changes state from active to idle the agent sends a
  message to the observer. 

  This message contains \(C_{s}\) for each output channel and
  \(C_{r}\) for each input channel of the agent.


  <p class="w3-text-teal">Observer Actions</p>
  The observer keeps only the latest message that it receives from
  each agent.
  
  For each channel \(C\), let \(C_{s}^{*}\) and \(C_{r}^{*}\) be the
  latest value of \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\), respectively, that the
observer has received.


  
<p class="w3-text-teal">Initial Condition</p>
All agents are idle.

\(C_{s}^{*}\) and \(C_{r}^{*}\) are the numbers of messages sent and
received (respectively) on channel \(C\) for all \(C\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</p>

<hr class="new2">  
  <p style="color:blue;">
  The observer detects computation has terminated if
  for all channels \(C\): \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).
</p>
<hr class="new2">  

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

  <p>
  We first prove that if the observer detects that the computation has
terminated then the computation has indeed terminated.

<p>
Since the observer has detected termination, for each channel \(C\),
either \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\) initially, or the observer received
messages containing \(C_{s}^{*}\) and \(C_{r}^{*}\) such that
\(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).


<p>
Let<code>(past, future)</code> be a partition of the steps of the
  computation where <code>past</code> consists of steps at an agent
  before the agent sent the messages to the observer containing
\(C_{s}^{*}\) and 
\(C_{r}^{*}\) for channels \(C\) incident on the agent. 
(If the agent sends no messages to the observer 
then the agent has no steps in <code>past</code>.)

<p>
From the property,
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html">
"Cut based on Counts of Messages Sent and
Received,"</a> <code>(past, future)</code> is a cut.

<p>
From the definition of terminated state it follows that the state at
this cut is a terminated state.

Termination is a stable property -- once computation has terminated it
remains terminated.

So, if the state at a cut of the computation
is a terminated state then all succeeding states are terminated states.

<p>
Next we prove that if the computation terminates then the observer
detects termination.

The last message sent by each agent has counts \(C_{s}^{*}\) and
\(C_{r}^{*}\) of the numbers of messages sent and received (respectively)
for each of its output channels \(C\).

Because these are the last messages sent when the algorithm terminates
it follows that \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\) for all \(C\).
