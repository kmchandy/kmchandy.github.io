  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Using Logical Clocks To Take Global Snapshots</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes an algorithm that uses logical time to determine
  global snapshots.
  The state at which all agents are at the same logical time \(t\) is
  a global snapshot.
  The algorithm used for logical time can also be used with epochs.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  Design an algorithm that computes global snapshots using logical
  clocks.
  </p>
   
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve the Problem?</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Strategy</h5>
  A strategy to develop any
  algorithm that deals with global snapshots is: Start with definition
  of consistent cuts.
  </p>

  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h5>
  <p>
  For any \(t\), define the <i><code>past</code> at \(t\)</i> in a
  computation as the set of steps with logical time at most \(t\),
  and define <i><code>future</code> at \(t\)</i>
  as the set of steps with logical time greater than
  \(t\).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  (<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\), <code>future</code> at
  logical time \(t\)) is a consistent cut.
  </p>
  
  <h6 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h6>
  From the <a href="LogicalClocks.html#SpecificationOfLogicalClocks">
  definition of logical time</a>, paths in the dataflow graph are from
  from smaller to higher  logical times.
  Therefore all paths to steps in <code>past</code> at logical
  time \(t\) are from steps in <code>past</code> at logical
  time \(t\).

    <a name="StateAtLogicalTime"></a>
    
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
    <p>
The <i>state at logical time \(t\)</i> is the state at the consistent cut
 (<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\), <code>future</code> at
logical time \(t\)), and is given by the labels of edges from steps in
<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\) to steps in
    <code>future</code> at logical time \(t\).

  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: State at Logical Time \(t\)</h5>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Figure 1 illustrates the state at logical time 6.5 of the
computation shown in figure 1.
  The curved purple line represents the boundary that
  separates the past of the cut from its future.
  Past steps are colored black while future steps are colored
green.
The states of agents and channels at logical time \(t = 6.5\) are
given by the labels of the edges that cut the purple line.
</p>

<figcaption>Fig. 1: Cut at Logical Time 6.5. Past is Set of Steps
    with Logical Time at most 6.5</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The point at which the cut boundary -- the purple line -- intersects
the timeline for agent \(A\) 
can be thought of as the point in \(A\)'s computation at which the
logical time is exactly 6.5.
The cut boundary intersects the edge from the step at \(A\) with
  logical time at most 6.5 to the step with logical time greater
  than 6.5.
  In this example, the cut boundary intersects the edge on \(A\)'s
timeline from step 3 to step 5.
</p>

  <p>
  The message edge from step 3 to step 7 represents a message sent
  along the channel from \(A\) to \(B\) in the past that is received
  in the future.

In this example, the state of the channel \((A, B)\) is the sequence
consisting of a 
single message which is the label of this edge.

Global Snapshot Algorithm to Record the State at a Logical Time
</h4>
<p>
An algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\) follows
    directly from the definition of the state at logical time \(t\).
    </p>

<ol>
  <li>
Each agent takes its local snapshot -- i.e. records its state -- after
a step with logical time at most \(t\) and before a
  step with logical time greater than \(t\).
  </li>
  <li>
An agent records the state of an input channel as the sequence of
messages with timestamps atmost \(t\) that the agent
  receives when its logical clock exceeds \(t\).
  </li>
</ol>
</div>
  <!-----END SECTION: Global Snapshot Algorithm for State at Logical Time ------------>

The labels of edges that cross the cut boundary -- the purple line --
in figure 1 represents the global snapshot at logical time 6.5.

  
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Epochs</h3> 
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The algorithm used with logical time can also be used with epochs
  because of the observation analogous to that of the observation we
made for logical time.

 <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h5>
  <p>
  For any \(t\), define the <i><code>past</code> at \(t\)</i> in a
  computation as the set of steps with epoch at most \(t\),
  and define <i><code>future</code> at \(t\)</i>
  as the set of steps with epoch greater than
  \(t\).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  (<code>past</code> at epoch \(t\), <code>future</code> at
  epoch \(t\)) is a consistent cut.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Intuition</p>
<p>
  We will design some algorithms with 
logical time playing the role of real time.
Figure 2 shows the computation in figure 1 with the horizontal axis
representing logical time.
The dataflow graphs are identical in figures 1 and 2; however, in
figure 2 the position of a step with logical time \(t\) is shown
at a distance of \(t\) units from steps at time \(0\).
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.018.jpeg"
  alt="Fig3" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 2: Computation with Logical Time as Real Time</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Think of logical time as continuous, just as real time is continuous.
In this example, points at logical times \(6.5\) and \(6.6\), at agent
\(A\), refer to the same edge -- the edge from step 3 to step 5.
It helps intuition, however, to think
of the point at logical time \(6.6\) at agent \(A\) as a point 0.1 time units to the right of
of the point with logical time \(6.5\) at \(A\).
</p>

<p>
The consistent cut at logical time \(6.5\) is represented in figure 2 by the vertical line
at time \(6.5\).
The steps to the left of the line is the past at logical time \(6.5\),
and the steps to the
right of the line is the future at that time. 


<p class="w3-text-teal">Physical and Logical Clocks</p>
<p>
Operating systems maintain clocks. Some have atomic clocks or other
  high-fidelity clocks that use Precision or Network Time Protocols
(PTP, NTP).
With high-fidelity clocks, a message sent when the sender's clock is
at \(t\) will almost always be received when the receiver's
clock is later than \(t\).
High-fidelity clocks almost always obey the logical clock requirement.
</p>

<p>
We cannot rule out the possibility that a message sent when the
sender's clock is later than \(t\) is received when the receiver's clock is
earlier than \(t\).
If this happens the logical clock requirement is violated because data
flows from a step at a later time to a step at an earlier time.
</p>

<p>
To prevent physical clocks from violating the logical clock
requirement we correct physical clocks using the logical clock algorithm.
If an agent receives a message with timestamp
\(T\) when the agent's clock is at \(T'\), then if \(T' < T\), the
agent corrects its clock -- i.e. moves its clock forward to a value
greater than \(T\).
</p>

<p>
Such "logically-corrected physical clocks" have the following properties that we use in
designing algorithms:
<ol>
  <li>
  Clocks tick forward forever: For all \(t\), there is a point in
  an infinite computation at which clocks of all agents exceed \(t\).
  </li>
  <li>
  Sequences of steps in ascending order of time are computations where
  the time of a step is determined by the local clock of the agent in
  which the step occurs. 
  </li>
</ol>
