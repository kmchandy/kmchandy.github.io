  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Using Logical Clocks To Take Global Snapshots</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes an algorithm that uses logical time to determine
  global snapshots.
  The state at which all agents are at the same logical time \(t\) is
  a global snapshot.

  Combining physical and logical clocks results in clocks that tick
  forward and where the state when all local clocks are at the same
  time is a global snapshot.

  </p>

   
  <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3> 
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  Design an algorithm that computes global snapshots using logical
  clocks.

  
   
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve the Problem?</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Strategy</h5>
  A strategy to develop any
  algorithm that deals with global snapshots is: Start with definition
  of cuts.
  
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h5>
  For any \(t\), define the <i><code>past</code> at \(t\)</i> in a
  computation as the set of events with logical time at most \(t\),
  and define <i><code>future</code> at \(t\)</i>
  as the set of events with logical time greater than
  \(t\).
  <p>
  (<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\), <code>future</code> at
  logical time \(t\)) is a cut.
  
  <h6 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h6>
  From the <a href=:LogicalClocks.html">definition of logical time</a>
  data flows forwards in logical time, i.e., from smaller to higher
  logical times.
  Therefore all data flows to steps in <code>past</code> at logical
  time \(t\) are from steps in <code>past</code> at logical
  time \(t\).

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">State at Logical Time \(t\)</h4>
The <i>state at logical time \(t\)</i> is the state at the cut
 (<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\), <code>future</code> at
logical time \(t\)), and is given by the labels of edges from steps in
<code>past</code> at logical time \(t\) to steps in
<code>future</code> at logical time \(t\).


<!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: State at Logical Time \(t\)</h5>
<!---------------------------------------------------------->
Figure 1 illustrates the state at logical time 6.5 of the
computation shown in figure 1.

  The curved purple line represents the cut.

  The cut separates the past of the cut from its future.

  Past steps are colored black while future steps are colored
green.

The states of agents and channels at logical time \(t = 6.5\) are
given by the labels of the edges that cut the purple line.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.019.jpeg"
alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
<figcaption>Fig. 1: Cut at Logical Time 6.5. Past is Set of Steps
    with Logical Time at most 6.5</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The point at which the purple line cuts the timeline for agent \(A\)
can be thought of as the point in \(A\)'s computation at which the
logical time is exactly 6.5.

This cut is on the edge from the step at \(A\) with
  logical time at most 6.5 to the step with logical time greater
  than 6.5.

  In this example the cut is on the edge from step 3 to step 5.

  <p>
  The message edge from step 3 to step 7 represents a message sent
  along the channel from \(A\) to \(B\) in the past that is received
  in the future.

In this example, the state of the channel \((A, B)\) is the sequence
consisting of a 
single message which is the label of this edge.



<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
Global Snapshot Algorithm to Record the State at a Logical Time
</h4>

An algorithm to record the state at logical time \(t\) follows
directly from the definition of the state at logical time \(t\).

<ol>
  <li>
Each agent takes its local snapshot -- i.e. records its state -- after
a step with logical time at most \(t\) and before a
  step with logical time greater than \(t\).
  </li>
  <li>
An agent records the state of an input channel as the sequence of
messages with timestamps atmost \(t\) that the agent
  receives when its logical clock exceeds \(t\).
  </li>
</ol>

The purple line in figure 2 represents the global snapshot at logical
time 6.5.


  <!--------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Using Imperfect Clocks in Distributed Algorithms</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Intuition</p>
  We will design some algorithms using 
logical time to play the role of real time.
Figure 3 shows the computation in figure 2 with the horizontal axis
representing real time.
The position of a step with logical time \(t\) is at a distance of
\(t\) units from the origin.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.018.jpeg"
  alt="Fig3" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig. 3: Computation with Logical Time as Real Time</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Think of logical time as continuous, just as real time is continuous.
In this example, points at logical times \(6.5\) and \(6.6\), at agent
\(A\), refer to the same edge.

It helps intuition, however, to think
of the point at logical time \(6.6\) as a location to the right of the
point at logical time \(6.5\) on the same edge.

Imagine that logical time \(6.6\) is 0.1 time units to the right of
logical time \(6.5\). 

<p>
The cut at logical time \(6.5\) is represented by the vertical line
at time \(6.5\).
The left of the line is the past at logical time \(6.5\), and the
right side of the line is the future at that time. 


<p class="w3-text-teal">Physical and Logical Clocks</p>
<p>
Operating systems maintain clocks. Some have atomic clocks or other
  high-fidelity clocks that use Precision or Network Time Protocols
(PTP, NTP).

With high-fidelity clocks, a message sent when the sender's clock is
at \(t\) will almost always be received when the receiver's
clock is later than \(t\).

So physical clocks almost always obey the logical clock requirement.

<p>
We cannot rule out the possibility that a message sent when the
sender's clock is later than \(t\) is received when the receiver's clock is
earlier than \(t\).

If this happens the logical clock requirement is violated because data
flows from later to earlier in time.

<p>
To prevent physical clocks from violating the logical clock
requirement we correct physical clocks using the logical clock algorithm.

If an agent receives a message with timestamp
\(T\) when the agent's clock is at \(T'\), then if \(T' < T\), the
agent corrects its clock -- i.e. moves its clock forward to a value
greater than \(T\).

<p>
Such clocks have the following properties that we use in
designing algorithms:

<ol>

  <li>

  Clocks tick forward forever: For all \(t\), there is a point in
  an infinite computation at which clocks of all agents exceed \(t\).
  </li>

  <li>

  Sequences of steps in ascending order of time -- where time at each
  agent is determined by the agent's clock -- are computations.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
