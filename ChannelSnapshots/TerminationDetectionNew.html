<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

  <p class="w3-text-green">
  This page uses material from
  <a
  href="../ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.html">
  Global Snapshots and State Detection.</a>
  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes algorithms to detect termination of
  computations.

  The general method of detecting states in computations is to take
  repeated global snapshots. Here we review the general method applied to the
  specific problem of termination detection. The concept of consistent
  cuts is the foundation of detection algorithms. In this page we describe a
  termination detection algorithm based on consistent cuts.
  </p>


    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Definition</h4>
    An agent is either <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. An idle agent
    remains idle until it receives a message at which point it becomes
active. An idle agent does not send messages.

An active agent may send messages. An active agent
may become idle at any point.

<p>
    Initially all agents are active and all channels are empty.

  A computation has
  terminated when all agents
  are idle and all channels are empty. 
  A computation may or may terminate.
 

<p>
    The problem is to develop an algorithm that detects that a computation
has terminated.
The detection algorithm may use messages and agents that are not part of the
  underlying computation.
  The detection algorithm must not modify the underlying computation.
  The specification of the algorithm in
  <a
  href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
  Global Snapshots and State Detection.
  </a>
  is repeated below for convenience.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specification of the Algorithm</h4>
  The algorithm has a boolean variable \(B\) where:
<ol>
  <li>
  If the computation terminates then the
  algorithm returns \(B = True\) when or after computation terminates.
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(B = True\) at any point then computation has terminated at that
  point. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">General Algorithm</h4>
<a
  href="ChannelSnapshots.html">
  A general algorithm for detecting stable properties
  </a> is for agents to repeatedly send local
snapshots to an agent, called a <i>detector</i>
that puts the local snapshots to get a global
snapshot and then checks whether all agents are idle and all channels
are empty in the global snapshot.
Let's look at a variant of the general algorithm.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specific Algorithm for Termination Detection</h4>
Let \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\) be the numbers of messages sent and
received (respectively) along channel \(C\).
Computation has terminated in a state in which all agents are idle and
for all channels \(C\): \(C_{s} = C_{r}\).

<p>
Each time an agent transits from active to idle it sends \(C_{s}\)
for each of its outgoing channels \(C\),
and \(C_{r}\) for each of its incoming channels \(C\), to the
detector.
The detector keeps the latest message that it receives from each
agent.
Let \(C_{s}^{*}\) be the last value of \(C_{s}\) that the detector has
received, and
let \(C_{r}^{*}\) be the last value of \(C_{r}\) that the detector has
received.

<p style="color:blue;">
The detector detects that computation has terminated if for
all channels \(C\): \(C_{s}^{*} = C_{r}^{*}\).
<p>
(Initially \(C_{s}^{*}\) is a negative value and \(C_{r}^{*}\) is 0 so
that termination is detected only after the detector receives messages
from all agents.)
