    <!--------------------------------------------------------->



The graph of agents has the following structure. (Recall that vertices
represent agents, and directed edges represent channels.) All cycles
in the graph pass through agent 0. There is a path from agent 0 to
every agent, and there is path from every agent to agent 0.

    <p>
The system has a set of indivisible indestructible tokens; however,
agents can create tokens. So, the number of tokens in the system may
increase but does not decrease.

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part 1<p>

Design an algorithm by which agent 0 gets a count \(N_{snap}\) of the
number of tokens in the system which satisfies the following
condition:
    <p>
    \(
    N_{init} \leq N_{snap} \leq N_{init}
    \)
<p>
where \(N_{init}, N_{fini}\) are the numbers of tokens in the system
when the algorithm starts and finishes (respectively).

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part 2<p>

    Give a short proof of the correctness of your algorithm.
