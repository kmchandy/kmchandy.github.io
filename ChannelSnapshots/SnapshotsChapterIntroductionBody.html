This chapter introduces concepts ---
<a href="./Timelines.html">timelines</a>,
<a href="./ChannelSnapshots.html">global snapshots</a>, and 
<a href="./LogicalClocks.html">logical clocks</a>,
that are helpful in developing several algorithms.

<p>
A timeline is a graphical representation of a trajectory; it shows the
sequence of states and transitions of each agent in time order.
These timelines are similar to timelines in history which show
significant events of countries over time.
Timelines are simple and useful in thinking about distributed
algorithms.
Cuts of timelines and <i>consistent cuts</i> are concepts that are
often used to design distributed algorithms.

<p>
Each agent has access to its own state but not the states of other
agents. An agent does not have access to the states of channels. Many
algorithms, however, require an agent to detect properties of
<i>global states</i>, states of all agents and all channels. The
global snapshot algorithm is a general way by which agents can detect
properties of states of other agents.


<p>
A logical clock algorithm is one in which each agent assigns a number,
called a <i>timestamp</i>, to each event  in its trajectory.
The global state obtained by collating the state of each agent and
each channel for any timestamp \(T\) must be valid.
Timestamps based on logical clocks can be used instead of real clocks
for many algorithms.

<p>Timelines, consistent cuts, global snapshots, and logical clocks
are closely related. These concepts will help us understand several
other algorithms.
