<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Applications of Global Snapshots</h1>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->


  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This webpage discusses a few of the many applications of global
  snapshots.


  <!---------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Collecting Local Snapshots to form Global
  Snapshots</h3>

  The global snapshot algorithm shows how each agent records its own
  local state and the states of its input channels.

  These local snapshots are collected together to form a global
  snapshot in some applications.

  <p>
  One way to collect local snapshots is to have a special OS agent act
  as an observer.

  Each agent sends its local snapshot to the observer which puts the
  local snapshots together to form the global snapshots.

  Successive global snapshots are disambiguated by using sequence
  numbers or timestamps.

  <p>
  Messages sent in a global snapshot initiated by an agent
  <code>X</code> when the local clock at <code>X</code> is at
  <code>t</code> have a timestamp <code>(t, X)</code>.

  Snapshot algorithms initiated by the same agent at different times
  have different timestamps, and snapshot algorithms initiated by
  different agents have different timestamps.



<!---------------------------------------------------->

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">System Monitoring</h3>

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h4>
  Let \(S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, \) be the sequence of states
  of global snapshots recorded by the system.

  There exists a computation that visits each state \(S_{i}\) in order
  of increasing \(i\).

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
  The proof is essentially the same as
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html#TheoremComputationsAndCuts">
the proof of the theorem
</a>
  "Computations and Cuts."


  <p>
  Systems are monitored by taking global snapshots repeatedly.
 The system monitor checks the sequence of snapshots to determine if
some action is required.
The action may be breaking a deadlock or rolling back steps of a
  computation. 


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Rollback and Recovery</h4>


Let \(S^{*}\) be the most recent snapshot recorded by a system monitor.

From,
<a href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Timelines.html#TheoremComputationsAndCuts">
the theorem "Computations and Cuts"
</a>
there exists a computation that starts at the initial state and 
visits \(S^{*}\).

So, if an error is detected in a computation then the computation can be
restarted from \(S^{*}\) rather than rolling all the way back to the
initial state. 



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Stable Predicates</h3>

A <i>stable predicate</i> is a predicate with the following property: If the
predicate holds at any point in any computation then it continues to
hold forever thereafter in that computation. Equivalently, if a stable
predicate holds in a state \(s\) then it holds in all states reachable
from \(s\).

<p>
Examples of stable predicates are: "The computation has
terminated," and "The computation is deadlocked."

If a computation has terminated at some point then it remains 
terminated.

Likewise if a computation has deadlocked then it remains deadlocked.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Specification of Detection Algorithms</h5>
An algorithm to detect a stable property \(P\) has the following
specification.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>No false positives</i>
  <p>
  If \(P\) holds when the algorithm is initiated then the algorithm
  detects that \(P\) holds.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>No false negatives</i>
  <p>
  If the algorithm detects that \(P\) holds then \(P\) holds when the
  algorithm terminates.
  </li>
</ol>

For example, an algorithm to detect whether a computation has
deadlocked must satisfy the following conditions.
<ol>
  <li>
  If the computation is deadlocked when the detection algorithm is
  initiated then the detection algorithm must detect that the
  computation is deadlocked.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the detection algorithm detects that computation has deadlocked
  then computation must be deadlocked when the detection algorithm
  terminates. 
  </li>
</ol>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Strategy for Developing Detection Algorithms</h4>
A general strategy for developing algorithms that detect stable
properties is as follows.

The operating system takes repeated snapshots of the computation and
determines that the specified stable property holds if it holds in any
snapshot.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Detection without Observers: Distributed
Algorithms on Local Snapshots</h4>

A general strategy is to use observers -- agents send their local
snapshots to an observer that puts the local snapshots together to get
a global snapshot and analyzes the global snapshot.

For some applications, a more efficient strategy is for agents to
exchange information about their local snapshots without sending the
information to a single observer.

<p>
Distributed algorithms on local snapshots operate in two phases.

In the first phase a global snapshot algorithm is executed.

The local snapshot of each agent and its incoming channels are stored
locally, at the agent, without sending the information to observers.

<p>
In the second phase a distributed algorithm is executed to determine
if the local information stored at agents satisfies a specified global
property, such as "computation has deadlocked."

These algorithms are often distributed graph algorithms.

<p>
Detecting properties of computations is hard because states in the
computatin change while the detection algorithm is running.

The two-phases separate the problem into two simpler parts: In phase 1, record
local states during the computation using a global snapshot algorithm.
In phase 2 analyze the <i>static</i> local snapshots.

The algorithm in the second phase operates on unchanging data, and
this simplifies the design of the algorithm.


<p>
The two phases can be executed concurrently in many applications.
