<!--------------------------------------------------------->
A timeline is a graphical representation of the sequence of state
transitions of a trajectory.

<p>
A state transition which changes the state of an agent is called an
<i>event</i> at that agent.  The graph of a trajectory is an acyclic
    labeled directed graph in which each vertex represents an event,
    and the edges are as follows: There is an edge directed from an
    event at an agent to the next event at that agent; the edge is
    labeled with the state of the agent between the two events.  A
    message \(m\) sent at an event \(e\) and received at an event
    \(e'\) is represented by an edge directed from \(e\) to \(e'\),
    and the edge is labeled \(m\).

<p>
The graph is acyclic because each edge is directed from an event
towards a later event.

A <i>timeline diagram</i> of a trajectory is a graph of the trajectory where
the graph is laid out in the following way.
The horizontal axis represents time.  

<p>
The events in the timeline are placed in the order in which they occur,
with events appearing earlier in the trajectory appearing earlier in
the timeline (i.e. towards the left).
For convenience, the initial state is represented by a set of initial events,
one for each agent, and these initial events are shown at the same
instant (same vertical line).

<p>
Each agent has its own timeline
represented by a horizontal line with all events
of the same agent on the same horizontal line. An edge from an event at an
agent to the next event at that agent is shown horizontally, directed
from left to right.

    <figcaption>Fig.1: A Timeline Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
This example shows a timeline diagram with two agents, \(A\) and
\(B\).  The vertices  A0, A1, A2, A3 represent events at agent \(A\);
likewise vertices B0, B1 B2,represent \(B\)'s events.

<p>
An edge along an agent's timeline is labeled with the state of that
agent at the point. For example, the edge from event A1 to event A2 is
labeled \(S[A1]\) which is agent \(A\)'s state after event A1 and
before event A2.

<p>
Event A1 is an example of an internal event in which an agent changes
state without receiving a message.
Event A2 is an example of an event in which an agent changes
state when it receives a message.

<p>
The diagram shows that
agent \(A\) sends message \(m_{0}\) in event A1 and this message is
received by agent \(B\) in event B1.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Channel States in Timeline Diagrams</h4>
The state of a channel \(c\) at time \(T\) is the sequence (in time
order) of messages that are sent along \(c\) before \(T\) and that are
received after \(T\). The state of \(c\) at \(T\) can be obtained from
the timeline diagram as the sequence of labels of edges representing
messages along \(c\) that are cut by the \(T\)-line, the vertical line
at \(T\).

<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.002.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Global State from a Timeline Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
Figure 2 shows 
timeline diagram with agents \(A, B, D\). Agent \(A\) sends messages
\(m_{0}\) along a channel \(x\) and sends \(m_{1}\) along a different
channel \(c\) at event A1.  When agent \(D\) receives \(m_{0}\) at
event D1 it sends message \(r_{0}\) to \(A\) along a channel \(y\).
When agent \(A\) receives \(r_{0}\) at event A2 it sends message
\(m_{2}\) to \(B\) along channel \(c\).  When agent \(B\) receives
message \(m_{1}\) at event B1 it sends message message \(u_{0}\) to
\(A\) along a channel \(v\).

<p>
The state of \(c\) at time \(T\) is the sequence of labels, \([m_{1},
m_{2}]\), of edges representing messages on \(c\) that are cut by the
\(T\)-line.  The state of an agent \(A\) at \(T\) is the label of the
edge on \(A\)'s timeline cut by the \(T\)-line.  So, the global state
of the system at T can be obtained from labels of edges cut by the
\(T\)-line.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Sequence of Global States</h4>
The sequence of <i>global</i> states in a trajectory can be 
obtained from the timeline diagram from the labels of edges cut by the
sequence of vertical lines before each event.
The starting and ending states of the trajectory are obtained from the
earliest (leftmost) and latest (rightmost) vertical
lines in the diagram.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Different Trajectories with Identical Graphs</h4>
Are there different trajectories with identical graphs?
Look at the next figure.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.005.jpeg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: A Different Trajectory with Same Graph</figcaption>
</figure>
The trajectory in this diagram is specified by the sequence of events:
Initial events (A0, B0, D0) followed by the sequence A1, D1, B1,
A2, A3, B2.

<p>
The graphs of figures 3 and 4 are the same but the trajectories that
the figures represent are different.  In figure 4 event B1 occurs
before event A2 whereas in figure 3, B1 occurs after A2.  So, the
global state after B1 and before A2 in figure 4 is never
visited in figure 3;
However, figures 3 and 4 have the same starting and ending states.
The following theorem captures the idea illustrated by figures 3 and
4.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h4>
Let \(X\) be a trajectory specified by a sequence of events, and
let \(Y\) be a permutation of this sequence with the following
property. For any pair of events \(e, e'\) where  \(e\)
appears before \(e'\) in \(X\):
\(e\) also appears before \(e'\) in \(Y\) if
<ol>
  <li>
  \(e\) and \(e'\) are events on the same agent, or
  </li>
  <li>
  a message sent in \(e\) is received in \(e'\).
  </li>
</ol>
Before we prove the theorem, let's see what the theorem means in terms
of timelines.
The first condition says that the local timelines for each agent ---
the horizontal lines --- are
the same in  \(X\) and \(Y\).
The second condition says that a message is received only after it is
sent. Together the conditions are that the graph of \(Y\) is the same
as that of \(X\), and all edges in \(Y\) are directed forwards in
time. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the theorem with \(X, Y\) as the
trajectores in figures 3 and 4, respectively.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h4>
The theorem holds trivially if \(X\) and \(Y\) are identical. If \(X\)
and \(Y\) are different then there exists a pair of consecutive events
\(e\) and \(e'\) in \(X\) where  \(e'\) appears after \(e\) in \(X\)
but \(e'\) appears before \(e\) in \(Y\). Let \(Z\) be the
trajectory obtained by flipping the order of \(e\) and \(e'\) in
\(X\).
We will prove that \(Z\) is also a trajectory. The diagram to the left
in the figure below shows the events before their order is switched, while
the diagram to the right shows the events after their order is switched.

<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.006.jpeg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Switching order of consecutive independent events</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let \(e\) be at an
agent \(A\) and \(e'\) be at an agent \(B\). From condition 1, agents
\(A\) and \(B\) are different.
Therefore, the state of \(A\) immediately before \(e\) and the state
of \(B\) immediately before \(e'\) are independent of the order of the
events. 
<p>
Because of condition 2, the message (if any) received in \(e'\) is
sent before \(e\), and the message (if any) sent in \(e\) is
received after \(e'\).
Therefore messages received in events \(e\) and
\(e'\) are independent of their order.
<p>
The messages received and the states of the agents before the
events are independent of the order of events.
So the messages sent and the states of the agents after the
events are independent of the order of events. Therefore \(Z\) is also
a trajectory. 

<p>
\(Z\) is closer to \(Y\) than \(X\) where the measure of closeness is
the number of out-of-order pairs of events. The proof follows by repeatedly
flipping out-of-order adjacent pairs until \(Y\) is obtained.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Cuts of Trajectories</h3>
A cut of a trajectory is a partition of the events in
the trajectory into two subsets called <i>past</i> and <i>future</i>.
A <i>consistent cut</i> is one
in which there is no edge in the graph from a <i>future</i> event
to a <i>past</i> event.

<p>The following are equivalent definitions of a consistent cut:
<ol>
  <li>
  All edges <i>to past</i> events are <i>from past</i> events.
  </li>
  <li>
  All edges <i>from future</i> events are <i>to future</i> events.
  </li>
</ol>
  

<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
The figure below shows cuts across timeline diagrams of two different trajectories
where past events are colored black and future events are green.
<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.010.jpeg" alt="Fig6" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Cuts of Timelines</figcaption>
</figure>

The cuts in both diagrams are identical: past events are A0, A1, B0,
D0, D1. 
The cuts are consistent because there is no edge from
green to black.
<p>
A purple vertical line, representing an instant in time, separates past from
future in the lower diagram.
By contrast, a curved line separates past from future in the upper
diagram. There is no vertical line that separates past from future in
the upper diagram because a past event (B1) appears after a future
event (A2).

<p>
Given the upper diagram, in which past and future are separated by a
curved line,
we can use the following intuitive method to obtain the trajectory of the lower
diagram in which past and future are separated by a vertical line.
Treat the purple curved separating line in the upper diagram as a
string, and pull the string taut. Doing so may push some events, such as
A2, to the right, and other events, such as B1, to the left.
As events move, while the string is tautened, all edges always remain
directed from past to future. This is because there is no edge that
crosses the string from the right to the left. Therefore the
conditions of the theorem are always satisfied.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem about Consistent Cuts</h3>
For any cut, \([past, future]\), of a timeline diagram of a trajectory
\(\tau\) there exists a trajectory \(\tau'\) with the same events as
\(\tau\) in which all \(past\) events occur before all \(future\) events.
<p>
The proof follows directly from the theorem on trajectories.

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
The cut in the diagram on the top of figure 5 is consistent.
Therefore, there exists a timeline diagram, shown at the bottom of the
figure, in which all past events occur before all
future events.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Corollary</h3>
Consider an algorithm that computes the state at a consistent
cut. Let \(s_{init}\) and \(s_{fini}\) be the states in which the
algorithm starts and finishes (respectively), and let \(s_{snap}\) be
the state at the consistent cut. Then there exists a trajectory from
\(s_{init}\) that visits \(s_{snap}\) and later visits \(s_{fini}\).

<p>
For example, an algorithm in the top diagram of figure 5 determines
the global state \(s_{snap}\) along the curved consistent cut during a
trajectory. Let \(s_{init}\) and \(s_{fini}\) be the states before the
algorithm starts and after it finishes, i.e. at the left and
right-hand ends of the timeline diagram. Then, the diagram in the
lower diagram of figure 5 also represents a trajectory 
from \(s_{init}\) to \(s_{snap}\) and then to \(s_{fini}\).


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Takeaway</h4>
Timelines are a familiar concept, helpful in
understanding distributed systems and other multi-agent
systems.
