  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Example (continue)</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  This example is a continuation from the example in
  <a href="BasicsStatesExamples">States</a>.

  
Two children, X and Y, are tossing balloons to each other.

A balloon that has been tossed by X, while in the air to Y, is a
message in the channel (X, Y\).

When a child gets a balloon it tosses the balloon back immediately.

Initially there is a balloon tossed by X on its way to Y and there is
also a balloon tossed by Y on its way to X.

<p>
  Each child has a countdown of the number of times it tosses balloons.

  Each time a child tosses a balloon it decrements its countdown value.

After a child's countdown reaches 0 the child pops balloons that it receives
(and doesn't toss popped balloons). 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State</h4>
The state of a channel is the number of balloons in it.

The state of an agent (X or Y) is the countdown value nX or nY, respectively.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Computation: A Sequence of States</h4>
An example of a sequence of state changes is as follows.
<ol>
  <li>
  Initial State: Channel (X, Y) has one balloon and channel (Y, X) has
  one balloon. And the countdown for X is 2 and the countdown for Y is
  3. We represent this state by:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and  sends it back. So the state
  becomes
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>There are no further steps in this computation
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Another Computation</h4>
What are other computations of the system?

<p>
Let's look at the event in step 3 of the above computation. The event
is as follows.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Event: X receives a balloon for the first time</h5>
This event is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  X's state before the event is nX = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message that is received is 1 (balloon) and the message is from
  Y. 
  </li>
  <li>
  X's state after the event is nX = 0
  <li>
  The message that is sent in the event is 1 (balloon) and the message is to
  Y. 
  </li>
</ol>

This event can be executed in any state S which satisfies the inputs
to this event:
<ol>
  <li>
  X's state before the event is nX = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message at the head of channel (Y, X) is 1. 
  </li>
</ol>

So, this event can be executed in the initial state.

<p>
You can now construct the following computation.

<ol>
  <li>
  Initial State: Channel (X, Y) has one balloon and channel (Y, X) has
  one balloon. And the countdown for X is 2 and the countdown for Y is
  3. We represent this state by:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes:
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 2, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and  sends it back. So the state
  becomes
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon sends it back. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>There are no further steps in this computation
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
A system may have many computations.

All the states of the computations of the system are states in the
<code>while</code> loop:

<pre>
Initial State

while there exists an executable event:
   execute any executable event
</pre>

In this example, after the initial state there were two executable
events: an event at X and an event at Y.
Either of these two events could have been selected as the next event
to be executed.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Invariant</h5>
An invariant of this system is:
<p>
Number of balloons is at most 2
<p>
which is equivalent to: <code>nX + nY + (X, Y) + (Y, X) <= 2</code>
<p>
(Here we are abusing notation using (X, Y) for a channel and also for
the state of the channel.)

<p>
To prove that this predicate (Boolean formula on variables of the
program) is an invariant we prove that (1) this predicate holds initially
(i.e., the formula is true initially) and (2) if it holds before any
step then it holds after the step.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Loop Variant</h5>
To prove that the function terminates we use the loop variant:
<code>nX + nY + (X, Y) + (Y, X)</code>

<p>
The loop variant is a function of the variables of the system.

We can carry out an induction on this function because it returns
integers and is bounded below.

The bound is not important. In our example, a bound is 0.

<p>
We prove that the computation terminates by showing that each step
reduces the variant function.
