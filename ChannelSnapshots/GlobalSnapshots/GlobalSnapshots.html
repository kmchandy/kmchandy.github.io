    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Global Snapshot Algorithm</h1><p>
    In this module, we develop an algorithm to determine a global
    snapshot: the state corresponding to a consistent cut. The
    algorithm is similar to the algorithm that assigns consistent
    timestamps to events. The key is identifying a consistent cut.

    <p>
    Before an agent \(a\) executes an event \(e\), the agent takes the
    following steps.
    <ol>
      <li>
      If \(a\) hasn't recorded its own state then it does so and also
      records the state of all unrecorded variables that are
      referenced in the event.
      </li>
      <li>
      If \(a\) has recorded its state then it records the state of all
      unrecorded variables that are referenced in the event.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Agents send the states that they record to a special agent that
    puts all the recorded values into the tuple that forms the global
    state. The algorithm terminates when the recorded states of all
    agents and shared variables have been received by the central
    agent. 


<h2 style="color:red;">Example</h2>
The following series of diagrams shows how agent and shared-variable
states are recorded during a trajectory. The first diagram shows the
recording algorithm being initiated by one or more agents recording
their states. In this example, the algorithm is initiated by agent
\(C\) recording its state after event 0 and before event 1. \(A\)'s
recorded state is shown by the black dot on \(A\)'s timeline.

<p>
This recording that initiates the algorithm is carried out independent
of the execution of any action.
    
<figure>
    <img src="AgentTimeline_08.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example - Recording algorithm is initiated</figcaption>
</figure>

During event 1, agent \(A\) references variable \(v\).
Since the states of \(A\)  and \(v\) have not
been recorded at this point, the execution of event 1 causes no
additional recordings.

<p>
All events executed by \(A\) before it records its state are in the
past with respect to this recording. Past events are colored black. An
event is in the past exactly when the states of the agent executing
the action and the variables referenced in the action haven't been
recorded. 

<p>
In event 2, agent \(C\) references variable \(w\). Since
\(C\)'s state has been recorded, \(C\) records the state of  \(w\)
before executing event 2 --- see rule 2 of the algorithm. The state of
\(w\) that is recorded is shown by a black dot.

<figure>
    <img src="AgentTimeline_09.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example - Event 2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In event 3, agent \(A\) references variable \(w\). Since
\(w\)'s state has been recorded, \(A\) records its own state 
before executing event 3. The state of
\(A\) that is recorded is shown by a black dot.

Event 1 is in the past with respect to this recording, and so it is
colored black.

<figure>
    <img src="AgentTimeline_10.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example - Event 3</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
In event 4, agent \(B\) references variables \(v\) and \(w\). Since
\(w\)'s state has been recorded, \(B\) records its own state and
\(v\)'s state
before executing event 4. The states of
\(B\) and \(w\) that are recorded is shown by black dots.

<figure>
    <img src="AgentTimeline_11.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Example - Event 4</figcaption>
</figure>

You can see that the the black dots form a 
of a consistent cut. Thus the recorded states of agents and shared
variables correspond to the global state along a consistent cut.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
Next we prove that the algorithm is correct. We need to prove that the
set of agent and shared-variable recorded states --- i.e., the set of
black dots --- forms a consistent cut. Equivalently, we need
to prove that every edge from the future is to the future (with respect to
the cut).

<p>
Consider an edge from event \(e\) to event \(e'\). If \(e\) is in the
future then the states of the agent executing the event and
all variables referenced in the event have been recorded at \(e\).
There is an edge from \(e\) to \(e'\) only if the agent executing the
events are the same or there is a shared variable referenced in both
events. If the same agent executes \(e\) and \(e'\), then from rule 1
it follows that if 
the state of the agent has been recorded at \(e\) then it has also 
been recorded at \(e'\); and therefore \(e'\) is in the future. The
same argument holds for the shared variables referenced in the event.
