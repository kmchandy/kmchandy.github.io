  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Progress</h2>

  We show that a distributed system progresses towards its goals by
  using the techniques used to prove that <code>while</code> loops terminate
  execution. 

  Later, we discuss temporal logic, which can be used to prove the
  correctness of all concurrent programs.



  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proving Termination of a Sequential While
Loop</h3>

We prove that execution of a while loop terminates by using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant">
loop variants</a>. 

A loop variant is a function from states to a well-founded set:
Each iteration of the loop reduces the value of this function and so
execution of the loop terminates because the loop variant cannot
  decrease for an infinite number of steps.


<p>
Let <code>f</code> be a loop variant and <code>Inv</code> an invariant
of a <code>while</code> loop.
To prove that the loop terminates we show that for all 
<code>k</code> :
If <code>Inv and (f = k)</code> holds before an iteration then <code>f <
k</code> after the iteration.


<p>
Links to examples of proofs of termination, loop variants, and well-founded sets
are given <a href="">here</a>.
A loop variant is also called a measure or a metric.

  <p>
  In some cases we can prove termination of a distributed system in
  exactly the same way as we prove termination of a while loop.
  In other cases we may need to resort to proofs of leads-to described later.

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example: Loop Variant for a While Loop</h5>

In the gcd example given earlier, a loop variant is <code>x +
y</code>. The loop variant is bounded below because <code>x, y</code>
are positive integers. 

The proof that each iteration of the loop reduces the loop variant is
straightforward.

  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Progress in a Distributed System</h3>

<p>
Some distributed systems never terminate and others are designed to
terminate execution.

In the latter case, we usually prove that a distributed algorithm terminates in the
exactly the same way that we prove that a sequential while loop terminates.

<p>
In some cases, distributed algorithms are designed not to terminate.
In such cases 
we typically need to show that if a predicate <code>P</code> holds in some
state of a computation then a predicate
<code>Q</code> holds then or later.
For example, if an agent is waiting to acquire access to a file then
it will eventually get access to the file.

<p>
We use an extension of loop variants for this purpose.

For convenience the while loop that generates computations is given
below.

  <pre>
while there exists a nonempty input channel in the system:
   select a nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   v executes receive(msg, u)
</pre>

<p>
We introduce the relation <i>leads_to</i> between predicates where
<code>P leads_to Q</code>, also written as <code>P</code> \(\leadsto\)
<code>Q</code>, means 
that if <code>P</code> holds in any state of a computation then 
<code>Q</code> holds in that state or in a later state of the
computation.
<p>
Let <code>f</code> be a function from the states of the system to a
well-founded set (exactly the same as a loop variant).

We prove <code>P leads_to Q</code> by showing the following 
properties called the <i>safety</i> and <i>progress</i> properties of
the loop variant.
<p>
If
<code>P and (f <= k) and not Q</code>
<br>
holds before an execution of the loop body then:
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Safety</i>: 
  For any nonempty channel <code>(u, v)</code> after a message is
  received on the channel the following holds:
  <br>
<code>(P and (f <= k)) or Q</code>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Progress</i>: 
  There exists a nonempty channel <code>(u, v)</code> such that after a message is
  received on the channel the following holds:
  <br>
<code>(P and (f < k)) or Q</code>
  </li>
</ol>
 
<p>
The safety property, without the progress property, allows for the possibility
that
<br>
<code>P and (f = k) and not Q</code>
<br> remains true for ever.
However, the progress property guarantees that there is a nonempty channel such
that receiving a message on that channel results in progress.

<p>
The intuition for this rule is given <a href="">here</a>.

The remainder of this page consists of examples.

  <!----------------------------------------------->
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: greatest common divisor across a network</h5>
Consider the example given in the page on <a
href="Invariants.html">invariants</a>: find the gcd of the local
variables of agents in a strongly connected network.
The <code>receive</code> function is given again for convenience.
<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   if n != gcd(n, message):
      n = gcd(n, message)
      for successor in successors:
         send(n, successor)
</pre>

The problem is to prove that the algorithm terminates.

A proof that the algorithm terminates is based on the following loop
variant: <code>(N, M)</code> where <code>N</code> is the sum of
<code>X.n</code> over all 
agents <code>X</code> and <code>M</code> is the total number of
messages in channels.

Comparisions of tuples are made
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order">
lexicographically:</a>
<br>
<code>(i, j) < (x, y)</code> exactly when <code>(i < x)</code> or 
<code>((i = x) and (j < y))</code>.

<p>
We prove that execution of each <code>receive</code> reduces <code>(N,
M)</code>. Consider two outcomes of the <code>if</code> statement:
<ol>
  <li>
If <code>n</code> is different from <code>gcd(n, message)</code>
  then <code>n</code> decreases and therefore <code>N</code> decreases.
  </li>
  <li>
If <code>n = gcd(n, message)</code> then  a message is removed and no
  messages are sent; this reduces
<code>M</code> while leaving <code>N</code> unchanged, and so the loop
  variant decreases.
  </li>
</ol>.



  <!----------------------------------------------->
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: Eventual Consistency</h5>
A network of agents consists of a single master database and satellite
databases.

Each satellite database contains copies, possibly out of synch,
with the master.

There is a path in the network from the master to all satellites.

The master is the only database that is modified.

<p>
When the master is modified it assigns a higher version number to the new
value and sends copies of the new value on its output channels.

When a satellite gets a copy on its input channel, if the version is
later than the satellite's copy then the satellite updates its
copy and sends the new value on its output channels.

The system is initialized with all agents at version number
0.

<p>
Let <code>A</code> be the master.
Let <code>x.n</code> be the version number of the copy at a agent
<code>x</code>.
An invariant <code>I</code> of the system is:
<br>
for all <code>x:  x.n</code> \(\leq \) <code>A.n</code>

<p>
The problem is to show that if the master version number is some value
<code>N</code> or greater then all the satellite versions catch up to
<code>N</code>.

We prove that <code>P</code> leads to <code>Q</code> where
<br>
<code>P </code> is  <code>A.n</code> \(\geq\) <code>N</code>
<br>
<code>Q </code> is  <code>for all x: x.n </code> \(\geq\)  <code>N</code>


<p>
A loop variant <code>f</code> is the number of satellites whose copies
have version number less than <code>N</code>.

The loop variant is bounded below. The proof of the safety property of
the loop variant is straightforward.

<p>
The proof of the progress property is as follows. If <code>P and not
Q</code> holds then there is a channel <code>(y, z)</code> where
<code>y.n</code> \(\geq\) <code>N</code> and <code>z.n</code> \(<\)
<code>N</code>.
From invariant <code>Inv_2</code> there is a message in the channel.
After the message in the channel is received
<code>z.n</code> \(\geq\) <code>N</code>, and so <code>f</code> is
reduced.
