    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">States, Transitions and Computations</h2>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">

  A model is an abstraction that ignores some features of systems
  while retaining features that help in  design.

  This webpage describes states, state transitions, and computations
  of a distributed system in a simple model.

  </p>


<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">States of a Distributed System</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
The state of a distributed system is a tuple with an element of the
tuple for the state of each of its agents and channels.

  <p>
The state of a banking system is a tuple with elements of the tuple
  for states of agents at ATM machines, branch banks, fraud analysis centers,
  and for states of channels connecting the agents.

  The state of an airplane navigation system is a tuple with elements
  for states of agents that estimate location, wind speed, and pitch, and 
  for states of channels connecting agents.

  <p>
  We refer to the state of the system as the <i>system state</i> to
  distinguish it from the states of its component agents and channels.

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Concurrent Operations: Many Agents are Active
  Simultaneously</p> 
  Agents in a distributed system operate concurrently.
  Many ATM machines are used at the same time and many people trade in a
  stock exchange at the same time.
  
  Dealing with multiple concurrent agents is difficult.

  The model uses a sequential program to represent a distributed
  system.

  We will show that the sequential program captures key aspects of
  distributed systems.

  
  <!-------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Sequential Program Representation of a
Distributed System</p>

A distributed algorithm is represented by a sequential program in which
  at most one agent changes state at a time.

  The sequential program initializes states of agents and channels and
  then executes the following while loop.


<pre>
while there exists a nonempty input channel in the system:
   select any nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   agent v executes receive(message=msg, sender=u)
</pre>

<p>

Execution of the system halts when all channels are empty.

We will discuss termination detection later.


<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computations</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
An agent is said to be <i>active</i> while it is executing a
<code>receive</code>.

An agent is <i>idle</i> when it is not active.

Many agents are active concurrently in a distributed system whereas at
most one agent is active at a time in the sequential representation of
the system.

We next use one further level of abstraction: 
<p>
<i>The model only considers system states in which all agents are idle.</i>

<p>
A state transition is from a system state
when an agent begins executing a <code>receive</code> to the system state 
 after execution of that
<code>receive</code> terminates.

The model does not deal with state changes that occur
while a <code>receive</code> is being executed.

<p>
A <i>computation</i> is a sequence of one or more system states where
there is a transition from each state in the sequence to the next.

A computation can start in any system state, though we will often deal
with computations that start in an initial state.

<p>
A computation may be infinite.

A maximal computation is a  sequence of states generated
  by the following <code>while</code> loop.

  Here <code>n</code> is the number of <code>receive</code> functions
that have been executed, and the sequence of states is <code>[S[0],
S[1], ..]</code>. 

<pre>
n = 0
while there exists a nonempty channel in the system:
    select any nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
    let the head of channel (u, v) be msg

    // State is S[n]
    agent v executes receive(message=msg, sender=u)
    // State is S[n+1]

    n = n + 1
  </pre>

You may wonder how a model of a distributed system can be useful if
the model only deals with states in which all agents are idle and the
model only deals with state transitions in which exactly one agent
changes state.

We show how the model is useful in the next page.

<p>
The remainder of this webpage consists of examples.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of a Simple Distributed System</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->

A system has two agents <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>.

The system has channels in both directions between the agents and also
from each agent to itself.

The system has one blue token and one red token.

Agents send tokens to each other.

A token is either at an agent or in a channel.

Later, when we discuss file management, we will use a token to
represent exclusive access to a file and use the token color to
identify the file. 


<p>
Initially  <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> hold the blue and red
token, respectively. The program that initializes variables is not shown.

Next, we describe the function <code>receive</code> which is written
in a Python notation.

Each agent is an object of a class, and <code>self.v</code> refers to
a local variable <code>v</code> of the agent.

The agents are constructed so that <code>self.other_agent</code> is
the other agent.

<p>
A message received by an agent is either a token sent by the other
agent or is a wakeup message that the agent sends to itself.

(More about the wakeup message later.)

<p>
If an agent receives a message from the other agent, then the message
must be a token; so the agent appends the token to the list of tokens
<code>self.list_of_tokens_I_hold</code> that the agent holds.

<p>
If an agent receives a message from itself, then the message must be a
wakeup, and the agent must hold at least one token.

In this case, the agent removes a token, <code>token_I_hold</code>,
from the list of tokens that it holds, and sends it to the other
agent.

<p>
If an agent is holding a token then it sends a "wakeup" message to
itself. See <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/PassingTokens.py"> an
implementation of the algorithm.</a>


<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   if sender == self.other_agent:
      // message is a token
      self.list_of_tokens_I_hold.append(message)
   else:
      # Sender is me. Message is wakeup.
      # Send a token I hold to other_agent.
      token_I_hold = self.list_of_tokens_I_hold.pop()
      send(token_I_hold, self.other_agent)

   # If I hold a token then wake me up later.
   if len(self.list_of_tokens_I_hold) > 0:
      send('wakeup', self)
</pre>



<p>
Figure 1 shows two states, \(S_{0}\) and \(S_{1}\), and
a transition from \(S_{0}\) to \(S_{1}\).

The diagram at the left of the figure shows a state \(S_{0}\) in
which agent \(u\) holds the blue token, agent \(v\) holds the red
token, channels \((u, v)\) and \((v, u)\) are empty, and channels
\((u, u)\) and \((v, v)\) each contain a wakeup message, shown as a
star.


    <figure>
    <img
    src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.002.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: A Token-Passing System</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The diagram at the right shows system state \(S_{1}\) in
which \(u\) holds no tokens, \(v\)  holds the red
token, channel \((u, v)\) has the blue token, channels \((u, u)\) 
and \((v, u)\) are empty, and channel \((v, v)\) contains a wakeup
message.

<p>
The transition from \(S_{0}\) to \(S_{1}\) occurs when \(u\) receives
a wakeup message on channel \((u, u)\).

In this transition \(u\) sends the blue token to \(v\) and \(u\)
changes to the state in which it holds no tokens.
 

<!----------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of a Computation</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
An example of a computation is the sequence \([S_{0}, \ldots S_{8}]\)
of states shown in figure 2.

Channels from each agent to itself aren't shown in the diagram for
each state so as to reduce cluttering.

There is a wakeup message (which is not shown) in the channel
from an agent to itself if the agent holds a token.

A state transition is labeled with the channel on which the message is
received that caused the transition.

    alt="Fig2" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example - A Computation is a Path in the State Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example a maximal computation has infinite length:

Agents can keep sending tokens to each other forever.
