    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Models of Distributed Systems</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
This page introduces models of distributed systems that we use in
these notes. A model is an abstraction that is helpful in designing
algorithms.

<p>
A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
message-passing channels.  Each channel has a name and is directed
from one agent to one agent.  A system is represented by a labeled
directed graph in which vertices represent agents and labeled directed
edges represent named channels.


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
The figure below shows a distributed system with agents A, B, C.

    <figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:50%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Graph Representation of a Distributed Systems</figcaption>
  </figure>
  An edge labeled \(z\) directed from a vertex \(A\) to
    a vertex \(B\)
represents a channel named \(z\) directed from agent \(A\) to agent \(B\).

A channel  \(z\) from an agent \(A\) to an agent \(B\) is called an
<i>outgoing</i> channel of \(A\) and an <i>incoming</i> channel of
  \(B\);
  only \(A\) can send messages and only \(B\) can receive messages
  along this channel.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h3>
  Each agent has a set of variables that are <i>local</i> to the agent;
other agents and channels cannot access these variables.
The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.
<p>
An agent may have a local clock; however, clocks are not
  synchronized across agents. At a point in a trajectory, a clock in
  one agent may be ahead, identical to, or behind the clock of another
  agent. 
  We will discuss clock synchronization later.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Channels</h3>
  We will look at systems with different types of channels.
  Let's begin with a model of first-in-first-out (FIFO) channels. 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State of a FIFO Channel</h4>
The state of a FIFO channel is a sequence of messages; these are
the messages that have been sent along
that channel and that have not been received.
The only way in which the sequence of messages in a channel can be
altered is that the agent sending messages along the channel can
append messages to the tail of the sequence, 
and a message can be removed from the head of the sequence and
delivered to the agent receiving messages along the channel.

<p>
Unless stated otherwise, the initial state of a channel is the empty
sequence. Then the \(n\)-th message received on a channel is the 
\(n\)-th message sent on that channel, for all \(n\). Furthermore, the 
\(n\)-th message is received on a channel only after the
\(n\)-th message is sent on that channel.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions</h3>
The state of a system is given by the states of its agents and
channels.  A system can change state in two ways: (1) A message is
delivered from a channel to an agent and the receiver changes state,
or (2) an agent changes state without receiving messages.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State Transition due to Message Delivery</h4>
When a message is delivered the
receiver's state may change, and the receiver may send messages on its
outgoing channels. The states of all agents, other than the receiver,
remain unchanged in the transition.  Likewise, the states of all
channels other than the channel on which the message is delivered and the
receivers's outgoing channels remain unchanged in the transition.
<p>
The state transition is specified by the  agent \(A\) that
changes state, the states \(s\) and \(s'\) of \(A\) before and after the event, the
channel \(c\) on which the message is delivered to \(A\), the 
message \(m\) delivered, and the message (if any) sent on each
outgoing channel of \(A\). 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State Transition without Message Delivery</h4>
This state transition changes the state of <i>one</i> agent and may send
messages on that agent's outgoing channels without messages being delivered.
The state transition is specified by the identity \(A\) of the agent that
changes state, the states \(s\) and \(s'\) of \(A\) before and
after the event, and the message (if any) sent on each
outgoing channel of \(A\).

<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
Consider a system state \(S\) of the system shown in Fig 1 in which
all channels other than \(x\) and \(y\) are empty.  There are multiple
transitions from \(S\) to other states because transitions can occur
due to the delivery of the message at the head of channel \(x\), or
channel \(y\), or because an agent changes state without receiving
messages.

<p>
Next, consider state transitions when the message in \(x\) is delivered.
Let \(S'\) be the system state
after a transition from \(S\) due to the delivery of a message in
channel \(x\).
The states of agents \(A, C\) are the same in \(S\) and \(S'\), while
the state of \(B\) may be different in \(S\) and \(S'\).

<p>
The states of channels \(u, v, t, z\) are the same in \(S\) and
\(S'\).  The state of channel \(x\) in \(S'\) is the same as its state
in \(S\) except that the head element is deleted.  The states of
channel \(y\) and \(r\) in \(S'\) consists of messages appended to
their corresponding states in \(S\).

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">States, Events and Trajectories</h3>
<p class="w3-text-teal">System</p>
A system is a set of initial states and a set of state transitions.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Trajectory, Execution, Computation</p>
A <i>trajectory</i> is a sequence \([S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots]\) of
states, where \(S_{0}\) is  
initial state, and where there exists a transition from \(S_{i}\) to
\(S_{i+1}\) for all \(i\). A trajectory can be finite or infinite.
<p>
We also use the terms <i>execution</i> and <i>computation</i> for a
trajectory.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Events</p>
An <i>event</i> \(e\) is a state transition and is specified by an
ordered pair of states 
\((S, S')\) where \(S\) and \(S'\) are the states before and after the
transition. The trajectory \([S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots]\) can also
be specified by the initial state \(S_{0}\) and
a sequence of events \([e_{0}, e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots] \)where
\(e_{i}\) is a transition from \(S_{i}\) to \(S_{i+1}\), for all \(i\).


<p class="w3-text-teal">Locality of Events</p>
An event is local to one agent and its incident channels in
the sense that it leaves the states of all other agents and channels
unchanged.
We call an event that changes the state of an agent
\(A\) <i>an event at \(A\)</i>.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Different Types of Channels</h3>
Most of the algorithms in these notes use FIFO channels; however, we
also describe algorithms that use other types of channels. Models for
a couple of them are described next.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Out of order messages</p>
Messages may be delivered out of order in some types of channels,
though each message is delivered once. We represent the state of such
a channel as a bag or multiset. A message is sent by adding the
message to the bag and a message is delivered by removing the message
from the bag.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Lossy, multiple delivery channels</p>
In some channels the same message may be delivered repeatedly, and a
message sent later may be received before a message sent earlier.  We
represent the state of such a channel by a set.  A message is sent by
adding it to the set, and a message is delivered by delivering a copy
of any element in the set without modifying the set.
