  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes timelines that represent executions of a
  distributed system, dataflow graph abstractions of timelines, and states and state
  transitions of distributed systems.
  </p>
 



  
<!--------------START SECTION: Timelines ---------------------->
<a name="Timelines"></a>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->

  The diagram below shows the timeline of the execution of a
  distributed system with agents X, Y, Z.
  The horizontal axis represents time flowing from left to right.
  Each horizontal line represents the state of one agent.
  For example, the top horizontal line represents the state of agent X at
  different points in time, the middle line shows the state of agent Y
  over time, and the lowest line shows states of Z at all points in time.
 
   
      <figure>
    <img
    src="TimelineDiagram.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 1: Timeline Diagram</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
  The blue boxes represent executions of receive functions. The red
  lines represent messages. A message to an agent is from another
  agent or from itself. Each receive function receives and processes
  exactly one message. So, each blue box has exactly one input red
  line.

  <p>
  Each receive is labeled in the diagram. For example, the sequence of
  receives for agent X are x1, x2, x3, x4. A message sent by agent Z
  while it is executing receive z1 is received by agent X which causes
  X to execute receive X2.

  <p>
  The state of an agent between successive receives is represented by
  the label (not shown) of the edge between the receives. For example,
  the state of agent X between receive x3 and x4 is the label of the
  edge after the end of x3 and before the start of x4.

  <p>
  The initial states of agents and channels are shown by dangling
  edges which have an end point but no start point. For example,
  initially there is a message that is received by agent X in receive
  x1 and this message is sent by agent Y. This message is shown by a
  dangling edge. Similarly there are dangling edges with start points
  but no end points to depict the final states of agents and channels
  in this execution. The execution may continue but we are showing
  only part of it.
  
<p>
  The duration of time that an agent takes to
  execute a receive varies.  When an agent executes a statement it may change the
  agent's variables and change the agent's program counter.
  So, an agent executes a receive the agent's state changes.
  The state of an agent at time t is represented in the diagram by the
  vertical line representing time t.

  <p>
  The state of the system consists of a tuple with an element of the
  tuple for the state of each component of the system. The components
  of the system are agents and channels. The state of a channel is a
  queue representing the sequence of messages in transit along the
  channel.

  <p>
  The state of the distributed system at time t is depicted by the
  states of the agents and channels intersected by the vertical line
  at time t. For example, the state of agent Y at time t is shown in
  the diagram as the point where the vertical line representing time t
  intersects the horizontal line representing the timeline of agent Y.

  <p>
  The state of a channel is shown in the diagram by the message lines
  intersected by the vertical line at time t. For example, there is a
  message from agent X to agent Y at time t.

  <p>
  Two important points to remember: (1) Message durations are positive
  and finite but arbitrary. (2) Agent clocks may drift by arbitrary amounts.
  We don't know how long it takes for a message to get to its
  destination. We do know that a message will get to its destination
eventually, and messages aren't received instantaneously.

<p>
An agent can timestamp a message with the time that the agent sends
the message where the timestamp is determined by the agent's own
clock. But that doesn't tell the receiver of the message when the
message was sent as measured by the receiver's clock.

<p>
Later, we will look at systems that don't make the assumptions that
message durations are unbounded or that agent clocks drift by
arbitrary amounts. For the time being, we will see the important
consequences of these two assumptions.

<a name="AgentLogs"></a>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agent Logs</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------->
<p>
Suppose each agent keeps a log of its state over time, as measured by
the agent's clock. If each agent's clock is perfect then the agent's
log is represented by the horizontal line of the agent in the timeline
diagram. The next figures shows the logs of agents X, Y and Z

   
<figure>
    <img
    src="TimelineDiagram.002.jpeg"
    alt="Fig2" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 2: Logs of Agents</figcaption>
</figure>

The top diagram of the figure shows the log of agent X, the middle
diagram is the log of Y, and the lower diagram is the log of Z.

<p>
Now suppose the agents send their logs to another agent which puts the
agent logs back together to obtain the timeline for the entire system.
Can you get the timeline that generated the logs from the logs?

<p>
There are several problems. The duration of time for each receive as
measured by the agent's clock may not be the true duration. So, we
don't know how long each of those blue boxes really is. Okay, then
let's simplify the problem assuming that duration of the execution of
all receives are the same. 

<p>
Can we determine the order of receives executed by different agents?
Given the logs of figure 2, can you determine whether executions y2
and z2 of receive functions in figure 1 started at the same time, or
did y2 start before z2, or z2 before y2?
We don't know how long a message takes to get to its destination.
So, it's possible that the message received in y2 has a short delay
compared to the message received in z2, and so y2 may start before z2.
It's also possible that the message delay for the message received in
z2 takes less time than the one to y2. So, z2 may start before y2.

<p>
In the following diagram agents A and B have the same logs.

   
<figure>
    <img
    src="TimelineDiagram.003.jpeg"
    alt="Fig3" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 3: Different orders of executions of receives with same logs</figcaption>
</figure>

In the diagram agent A executes two receives shown as vertices a0 and
a1, and agent B executes two receives shown as vertices b0 and
b1. Do the agent logs tell us if the receive a1 occurred before the
receive b1, or at the same time, or afterwards?

<p>
The agent logs don't tell us. We do know that the receive b0 occurred
before the receive a1 because a1 receives a message sent during the
execution of a1. However, we don't know the relative ordering of a1
and b1.

<p>
In figure 1, do we know that z1 occurred before y4?

<p>
It's possible that y4 occurs before z1. Here is a possible sequence of
executions of receives: x1, y1, x2, x3, y2, y3, y4, x4, z1, z2, z3,
z4. But it's also possible that z1 occurs before y4.

  
<!--------------START SECTION: Dataflow Graphs ---------------------->
<a name="DataflowGraphs"></a>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow Graphs</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->

<p>
So, what can we get about the execution of the entire system from the
collection of agent logs? We can get the dataflow graph which shows
the flow of information between agents. The dataflow graph for the
timeline diagram of figure 1 is shown in the next diagram.

   
<figure>
    <img
    src="TimelineDiagram.004.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Dataflow Graph Abstraction of Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Edges and Agent Edges</p>
<p>
A dataflow graph is a directed acyclic labeled graph.
The vertices of the graph represent executions of receives. The graph
has two types of edges: message edges and agent edges. A message edge
is labeled with the contents of the messages and shows a message sent
during a receive. A message edge is directed from the receive that
causes the message to be sent to the receive in which the message is
delivered. The labels of agent and message edges are illustrated in
the diagram below.

<figure>
    <img
    src="Dataflow.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 5: A Vertex with Labels of Agent and Message Edges</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
An agent edge is directed from a
receive executed by an agent to the next receive executed by the same
agent. An agent edge is labeled with the state of the agent between
the receives. (This diagram doesn't show labels.)

<p>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Steps</p>
We call the execution of each receive a <i>step</i> in the
dataflow graph.
Steps and vertices of a dataflow graph are identical.
Later we will also use steps in computations.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Fictitious Initial and Final Steps</p>
<p>

We have a fictitious initial step for each agent which represents the
creation of the initial state of that agent.
For example, in figure 4, x_init represents a step that creates the initial state of
agent X and also the initial messages in the channels from agent X.


<figure>
    <img
    src="Dataflow.003.jpeg"
    alt="Fig3" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 6: Fictitious Initial Event at Agent u</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Likewise, we have a fictitious final step for each agent which represents
the final state of the agent and the messages in transit to the agent
in the final step. For example, in figure 4 there is a message from X to Y, and
there is also a message from Z to Y in the final state.

<p>
The figure shows the dataflow graph for a
system consisting of two agents <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, and
with two channels <code>(u, v)</code> and <code>(v, u)</code>.
    Steps 1 and 4 of the dataflow are at agent <code>u</code>, and steps 2 and 3 are
    at <code>v</code>.
    The initial states at agents <code>u</code> and
<code>v</code> are represented by outputs of steps <code>u_init</code>
and <code>v_init</code>, respectively, and final states by inputs to
<code>u_fini</code> and <code>v_fini</code>, respectively.
    </p>
    
<p>
The labels <code>u1, u2, u3</code> are: (1) the initial state
of agent <code>u</code>, (2) the state of <code>u</code> between steps 1
and 4, and (3) the state of <code>u</code> after step 4, respectively.
Likewise, the labels <code>v1, v2, v3</code> are the states of
agent <code>v</code> initially and after steps 2 and 3, respectively.
</p>

    <p>
    Message edges are labeled <code>m1, m2, m3, m4, m5</code>.
    Initially channel <code>(u, v)</code> contains message
    <code>m2</code> and channel <code>(v, u)</code> contains message
    <code>m1</code>.  Message <code>m3</code> is sent in step 1 and
    received in step 3, and message <code>m4</code> is sent in step 3
    and received in step 4.

<h4 class="w3-text-red">Another Example of Timelines and Dataflow
Graphs</h4>

The figure below is an example of a timeline with two agents u and v.
Agent u executes two receives represented by rectangles labeled 1 and
4, and agent v executes two receives represented by rectangles labeled
2 and 3. While agent u is executing its first receive (rectangle 1),
agent v is also concurrently executing its first receive (rectangle
2). Agent v finishes executing its first receive while agent u is
still continuing to execute its first receive. During this execution
agent u sends message m3 which is received by agent v which executes
its second receive (rectangle 4). Agent v finishes execution of both
its receives while agent u is executing its first receive.

Timelines are important in distributed cyber-physical systems, and
we'll look at them later.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Changing the Granularity of States</p>
<p>
You may want to analyze system states that include states of an agent
while it is 
executing a receive because analyzing states before and after
executing the receive may miss important aspects.
For example, suppose the receive function has a
while loop and you want to analyze the states of the distributed
system after each iteration of the loop.
You can make internal states of the receive function observable in the
system state by having the agent generate a "next iteration
message" from the agent to itself.
When the agent receives a "next iteration message"
the agent executes the next iteration of the loop.
Messages that it receives from other agents are enqueued locally and
processed later. So, the granularity of the
state space is a design decision.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Flow of Data between Steps</p>
<p>
A dataflow graph is
    acyclic because an edge is directed from execution of a receive
    function by an agent to a later execution of a receive function by
    the same agent or the edge is directed from the execution of a
receive function in which a message is sent to an execution of a
function that receives the message.

<p>
    The edges of the dataflow graph of a computation show the flow of
    data into and out of each step.  Data -- in the
    form of the agent's state -- flows from a step at an agent to the
    next step at that agent.  Data -- in the form
    of message contents -- flows from a step in which a message is
sent to the step in which the message is received.
We will say that "data flows from a step u to a step v"
exactly when there is a path in the dataflow graph from u to v. Some
papers use the phrase "u causes v" or "v depends on u."
In the figure below, data flows from step 2 to step 4, or equivalently
    step 4 depends on step 2.
</p>


<figure>
    <img
    src="Dataflow.005.jpeg"
    alt="Fig5" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 9: Data flows from step 2 to step 4</figcaption>
</figure>

We say that two vertices (steps) of a dataflow graph are independent
exactly when there is no path between the vertices.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Agent logs specify a unique dataflow graph but
not the ordering among independent steps</p>
<p>
Given the logs that agents make during an execution of a system, there
is a <i>unique</i> dataflow graph that is consistent with the logs.
The logs specify a unique dataflow graph but do not specify the order
of execution of independent events. For example, 
the logs in the figure below do not specify whether step 1 occurred before,
after or during step 2.


<figure>
    <img
    src="Dataflow.006.jpeg"
    alt="Fig6" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 10: Switching order of independent events with
    the same dataflow graph</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The diagram on the top illustrates a sequence of steps 1, 2, 3, 4
while the lower diagram illustrates sequence 2, 1, 3, 4. Both diagrams
have the same agent logs, and therefore the same dataflow graph.


     
 
<!--------------START SECTION: States ---------------------->
<a name="States"></a>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">States</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->
   <p>
    The future behavior of a system from its current state is
    independent of the system's past behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
    The state of a distributed system is given by the states of its
    agents and channels.  A system state is a tuple with an element of
    the tuple for the state of each agent and each channel.


    The state of a channel is a queue consisting of the sequence of
    messages sent on the channel that have not been delivered.  The
    state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="BasicsStatesExamples.html"> examples of states and state
transitions</a> and <a href="BasicsStatesFAQ.html">questions about
states of distributed systems.</a>

<!--------------START SECTION: State Transitions--------------->
<a name="StateTransitions"></a>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions and Events</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->

       <p>
    There exists a transition from a state <code>S</code> to a state
    <code>S'</code> exactly when in state <code>S</code> there is
    a nonempty channel <code>(v, u)</code> and the delivery of the
    message <code>m</code> at the head of the channel to agent
    <code>u</code> and the execution of
    <code>receive(message=m, sender=v)</code>
    by agent <code>u</code> causes a transition to state <code>S'</code>.

   The change in state is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state <code>s</code>
  before it executes the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  The sender, <code>v</code>, of the message, and the message,
  <code>msg</code>, that is received,
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state <code>s'</code> after it completes execution
  of the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  For each channel <code>(u, v)</code> from <code>u</code>, the
  sequence of messages that <code>u</code> sends along the channel
  while it executes the <code>receive</code>. The sequence of messages
  is the empty sequence if <code>u</code> sends no messages along the
  channel during the receive.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
The 4-tuple is called an <i>event.</i>
The first two elements of the tuple are called the <i>inputs to the
event</i>, and 
the last two elements are the <i>outputs of the event</i>.
The states of all agents other than <code>u</code> remain unchanged in
this transition.
The states of channels not listed in the event also remain unchanged.
The only changes in a state transition are changes to a single agent
and the channels incident on that agent.

<p>
Each vertex of the dataflow graph represents the execution of an
event.

<figure>
    <img
    src="Dataflow.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure 11: An Event is Represented by a Vertex of the
    Dataflow Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

The same event can occur multiple times in a dataflow graph.
This is because an
agent may execute a receive function with the same input and in the
same state multiple times.
So, there may be multiple vertices of the dataflow graph with identical
labels of inputs and outputs.
Each execution of a receive function is a different step of the
dataflow graph.
So, there may be multiple vertices with identical inputs and outputs,
and each of these vertices is a different step.


<p>
We assume that the receive function is <i>deterministic</i>.
The output of an event is a function of its input.

<p>
If all channels are empty in a state S then there is no transition
from S.



<p class="w3-text-teal">Locality of Events</p>
<p>
An event specifies the state transition of a single agent and the
edges incident on it when the agent executes its receive function;
the event does not specify the states of other agents and channels.
A transition from a state S to a state S' specifies the states of
<i>all agents and all channels</i> in S and in S'.
A state transition specifies the global (entire) state of a system
before and after the transition.
In contrast, an event specifies the local states of a single agent and its
incident edges before and after the transition.


<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of State Transitions and Events</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------->
    <p>
    This example is of an event at agent, <code>pos</code> from the <a
    href="Basics.html#Example">previous page.</a> In this example,the
    state of <code>pos</code> before the event is given by the values
    of its variables <code>my_data = [3, 5]</code> and <code>n =
    0</code>.  In the event, <code>pos</code> receives a "wakeup"
    message from itself. A wakeup message is shown as a star in the
    diagram. 
    </p>
    
      <figure>
    <img
    src="ComputationExamples.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:75%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure State S_0: Initial State</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
The execution of the event (<code>receive('wakeup', pos)</code>)
causes a state transition from state
    S_0, shown in the figure above, to state S_1, shown in the figure
    below. 
    </p>

      <figure>
    <img
    src="ComputationExamples.002.jpeg"
    alt="Fig2" style="width:75%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure State S_1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
<p>
<code>pos</code>'s state after the event is <code>my_data = [3,
5]</code>  and <code>n  = 1</code>.
During the event <code>pos</code> sends a "wakeup" message to itself
and sends 3 to agent <code>total</code>.
The event is specified by the following tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>pos</code>'s state before it executes the <code>receive</code>
  is given by the values of its variables <code>my_data = [3,
  5]</code> and <code>n = 0</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The sender of the message that is received in this event is <code>pos</code>, and
  the message is "wakeup".
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>pos</code>'s state after it completes execution
  of the <code>receive</code> is given by <code>my_data = [3,
  5]</code> and <code>n = 1</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The messages sent during the execution of <code>receive</code> are
  (i) "wakeup" to <code>pos</code> and  (ii) <code>3</code> to
  <code>total</code>. 
  </li>
</ol>

The states of the other agents -- <code>neg</code>,
<code>total</code>, and <code>X</code> -- remain unchanged in this state
transition. Likewise, the states of channels that are not incident on
<code>pos</code> -- channels <code>(neg, neg)</code>, <code>(neg,
total)</code>, and <code>(total, x)</code> -- remain unchanged in the
transition.

</p>



  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computations</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->
   <p>
    A <i>computation</i> is a sequence of states, where there exists
    a transition from each state in the sequence to the next.

      A computation may be finite or infinite.  A computation may
      start in any state.  We will often prove properties of
      computations that start in an initial state of the system;
      however, a computation is not restricted to starting in an
initial system state.

<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of a Computation</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------->
The next series of figures shows a computation. Each figure shows a
state. There is a transition from the state shown in a figure to the
state shown in the next figure. There is a computation that starts in
the state shown in the first figure below to the state shown in the
last figure.

Every subsequence of a computation is also a computation. For example,
there is a computation that starts in the state shown in the second
figure to the state shown in the fifth figure.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Sequential Program Representation of Computations</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->
All computations starting from a state
\(S_{0}\) are sequences \([S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, ]\)
of states generated in the following while loop.

      <hr class="new2">
      <pre>
# The initial state is S[0]
step_number = 0
while there exists a nonempty channel:
   # state is S[step_number]
   select any nonempty channel (v, u)
   let m be the message at the head of (v, u)
   deliver m to agent u which executes receive(m, v)
   step_number = step_number + 1
</pre>
      <hr class="new2">

      <p>
      The loop terminates when all channels are empty.  The selection
      of the nonempty channel in an iteration is nondeterministic --
      <i>any</i> nonempty channel can be selected.  Different
      computations are generated by making different selections of the
      nonempty channel in each iteration. When we prove properties of
      computations we have to consider all possible selections of
      nonempty channels.
      </p>



<p>
A benefit of using the states in a while loop to represent the states 
of a computation is that we can use familiar techniques
---
such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">
loop invariant</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant">
loop variants</a> ---
for reasoning about sequential programs to reason about
    distributed algorithms as well.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow Graph of a Computation</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

Each computation has a unique dataflow graph associated with it.
The steps of the dataflow graph are executions of receive functions in
the computations. The agent and message edges of the dataflow graph of
the computation are as given before.
<p>
A computation is a <i>total</i> ordering of executions of receive
functions. A dataflow graph is a <i>partial</i> ordering of executions
of receive functions because the graph is acyclic. Many computations
can have the same dataflow graph.


<figure>
  <img
    src="ComputationExamples.011.jpeg"
    alt="Fig11" style="width:100%"> 
</figure>
The figure above shows the dataflow graph for the computation shown in
the previous diagrams. The black edges are agent edges and they are
  labeled with the states of agents. The blue and red edges are
  message edges and are labeled with the contents of messages. The red
  edges show internal messages, i.e., messages from an agent to
itself. The top row shows steps at agent pos, the next row shows steps
  at agent neg, and the bottom two rows shows steps at agents total
  and X. The numbers inside the steps for pos and neg are the value of
  n at steps. The numbers inside the steps for total show the value of
  sum. Not all labels on agent edges are shown in the diagram.

<!----------------------------------------------->
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
  topological sort</a> of a directed acyclic graph is a sequence of
  vertices of the graph where for every edge \((x, y)\) in the graph,
    \(x\) appears before \(y\) in the sequence.
    </p>

    <h5 class="w3-text-red">Examples of Sequences that Are and Are Not
    Topological Sorts</h5>

<p>
Sequences [1, 2, 3, 4] and [2, 1, 3, 4] are topological sorts of the
graph.
Sequence [1, 2, 4, 3] is not a topological sort because there is a backward
edge , i.e., an edge directed from a later vertex in the sequence (i.e, vertex 3) to
an earlier vertex (4) in the sequence.

  <h3 style="color:blue;">Theorem: Topological Sorts of Dataflow</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

<p style="color:blue;">
All topological sorts of a dataflow graph of a computation are
computations. 
</p>
<hr class="new2">
<p>

<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of the Theorem</h6>
Let \(G\) be the dataflow graph of a computation specified by a
sequence of steps \(E = [e_{0}, e_{1}, \ldots]\).
Let \(E'\) be a topological sort of \(G\).
We will prove that \(E'\) is also a computation.

<p>
The theorem holds trivially if \(E'\) and \(E\) are identical.
If \(E\) and \(E'\) are not identical then there exists an adjacent
pair of steps \(e_{i}, e_{i+1}\) in \(E\) where \(e_{i+1}\) occurs
before \(e_{i}\) in \(E'\). Because \(E'\) is a topological sort,
there is no edge in the dataflow graph from \(e_{i}\) to \(e_{i+1}\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(H\) be the sequence of steps identical to \(E\) except that the
order of \(e_{i}\) and \(e_{i+1}\) is switched  in \(H\).
From the lemma \(H\) is also a computation.
The number of out of order pairs between \(H\) and \(E'\) is less than
that between \(E\) and \(E'\).
By repeatedly switching independent, adjacent, out-of-order pairs
the sequence \(E'\) is reached.
    </p>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Equivalent Statements of the Theorem</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
A sequence of steps of a dataflow graph is a computation exactly when:
For all steps v, w in the graph where there is a path
from v to w: v appears before w in the sequence.
</p>
<hr class="new2">


Equivalently, a sequence of steps is a computation if for all steps v,
w: if data flows from v to w then  v appears before w in the sequence.

<p>
We may also use phrases such as "data flows forwards" in
a computation or "each step depends only on earlier steps" of a
computation. 


<!-------------START SECTION: Model Strengths and Limitations ------------->
  <a name="ModelStrengthsAndLimitations"></a>
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Model Strengths and Limitations
Limitations</h4>

<p>
Agents in many distributed systems have semi-synchronized clocks;
though the clocks are not perfect, they do not drift apart by
arbitrary amounts.
The time that a message is in flight in some distributed systems can
be bounded.
Distributed cyber-physical systems have clocks that are synchronized
(if imperfectly) and assume bounds on message delay.
The model that we have described is inappropriate for such systems.
Later we discuss models that do include clocks and bounded message
delays. 

<p>
A dataflow graph faithfully represents the flow of data between
steps; however, a dataflow graph is not a timeline.
Dataflow is adequate for many distributed applications.

<p>

A state transition represents a change from a state in which all
agents are idle to a state in which all agents are idle. The
      transition captures the change in state of exactly one agent when it
executes a <code>receive</code>.
A computation is a sequence of states where  all agents are idle in
every state in the sequence.
Restricting consideration of states in which all agents are idle may
seem a severe limitation of the model.


<p>
As we saw, the sequence of states of a computation are the states in a
<i>sequential</i> nondeterministic while loop.
It may appear that the model is weak because we are representing
dynamic, multi-agent, concurrent systems by sequences.
We will see that these limitations are not restrictive.
