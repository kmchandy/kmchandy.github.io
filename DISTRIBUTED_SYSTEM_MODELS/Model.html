<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines and Dataflow</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A <i>timeline</i> shows how the state of a system changes over time.

  A <i>dataflow graph</i> (dataflow for short) is an abstraction of a timeline; this
  abstraction has no concept of time other than an ordering of
  <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>.

  We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using a time-free
  model. 
  </p>
  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline">
  Timelines</a> are used to describe the interactions of nations, animal
  species, and ideas, over time.

  Here timelines describe the interactions of agents over time.

  
  <p>
  While an agent executes a  <code>receive()</code> the agent's state
  changes over time and the agent may send messages at different
  points in time.

  The evolution of the state of a system over time is depicted by a
  timeline diagram in which the horizontal axis is the time axis or t-axis.

  <p>
  Figure 1 shows states of a system with two agents \(u\) and
  \(v\).
  
  Each horizontal line shows the state of an agent at each point in
  time. 

  The lower horizontal line shows the states of agent v
  and the upper horizontal line shows the states of agent u.


    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>

  

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Representation of execution of a receive</p>
  
An execution of a receive is represented by a rectangle, and
the length of the rectangle represents the time to execute the
  receive.

For example, rectangles 1 and 4 represent receives executed by agent
<code>u</code>, while rectangles 2 and 3 represent receives executed by 
<code>v</code>.

  The state of the agent changes as the receive is executed and is
specified at each point in the rectangle.

<p>
Horizontal edges between successive executions of receives on the
timeline of an agent are labeled with the 
state of the agent at those points.

For example, the state of agent <code>v</code> between its second and
third <code>receives</code> is <code>v2</code>.


  <p class="w3-text-teal">Representation of a message</p>
  Each message is represented by a line which is labeled with the
message.

The line starts from the point on the sender's timeline at the time that the
message is sent.

The line ends at the point on the receiver's timeline at the time that the
receiver starts executing the <code>receive()</code> which receives
  the message.

For example, messages m2 and m3 are sent by \(u\) while it is executing its
  first <code>receive</code>.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Representation of an instant in time</p>
An instant at time T is represented by a vertical line T units to the
right of the origin.

The state of an agent at time T is the state where the vertical line
at T intersects the horizontal line representing the agent's state.

The state of a channel at T is shown by the labels of the channels' message lines
that intersect the vertical line at T.

<p>
In figure 1, time T is represented by the dotted red line.
At T, agent
<code>u</code> is executing its first receive and <code>v</code> is
executing its second; channel
<code>(v, u)</code> contains a single message; <code>m4</code>, and 
channel <code>(u, v)</code> is empty. 

<p>
The initial state of the timeline is given by the initial states of
agents and channels and is shown by the labels of the edges
representing agent states and messages from the point at time 0 -- the
point at which execution starts.



<p class="w3-text-teal">A system may have many timelines</p>
The hardware on which a distributed algorithm executes may be unspecified.

The operating system executing a distributed algorithm may interrupt
an agent executing a <code>receive</code> and restart it later.

Some agents may execute on slower processors than others.

The communication mechanism may get congested causing message
delays to change.

We can determine properties of the timelines of a distributed
algorithm only if we have specifications of the operating system and
hardware on which the algorithm executes, and we often don't have the
information. 



<p class="w3-text-teal">The passage of time</p>
The passage of time, as determined by an agent's local clock, may play
a role in the behavior of a system.

For example, a receive function of an agent may have a sleep statement
(e.g., <code>time.sleep(t)</code> in Python).

The system behavior may depend on the fact that one agent sleeps for 1
second while another agent sleeps for 10 seconds.

Local clocks are not perfectly synchronized; however, a system
designer may know that clocks are usually accurate and may use clocks
in designing the system.

<p>
Next, we describe a model that ignores time and makes no assumptions
about how far local clocks may drift from each other and from true
time.

Later, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using our weak
model.



  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <!----------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Events</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

The top diagram of figure 2 depicts an execution of
<code>receive</code> as time progresses, and the lower diagram ignores
time and restricts attention to the states of the agent before and
after execution of the receive.

    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.002.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Representation of receive with and without time</figcaption>
</figure>

An execution of a <code>receive</code> by an agent
<code>u</code> is specified by an <i>event at <code>u</code></i>.

An event in which an agent <code>u</code> executes
  <code>receive(msg, v)</code> is a 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state before it executes the <code>receive</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
  the message, <code>msg</code>, received and the sender, <code>v</code>, of the message,
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state after it completes execution of the <code>receive</code>, and  
  </li>
  <li>
  for each output channel of <code>u</code>, the sequence of messages
  sent and the receivers of the messages.
  </li>
</ol>
The first two elements of the tuple are called the <i>inputs to the event</i>, and
the last two elements are the <i>outputs of the event</i>.

An event does not specify the duration of a receive, or the state of
an agent while it executes a receive, or when messages are sent during
execution of a receive.

<p>
An agent's <code>receive</code> function can be specified by the set
of events at that agent.

We say that an agent <i>executes event e</i> to mean that the agent executes a
<code>receive</code> that is specified by <i>e</i>.

An agent changes state by executing a sequence of events where the
agent's state after the \(i\)-th event is its state before the
\(i+1\)-th, for all \(i\).




  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->
A dataflow graph is an abstraction of a timeline diagram.

An execution of a receive is represented by a vertex in the dataflow
graph whereas it is represented by an evolution of the agent's state
in a timeline.

The lower diagram of figure 3 is the dataflow abstraction of the
timeline shown in the upper diagram.


  
    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.003.jpeg"
    alt="Fig3" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example: Dataflow Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Vertices in Dataflow</h5>

A dataflow graph of a system is a labeled, directed, acyclic graph.

Each vertex represents the execution of an event at an agent.

The inputs and outputs of each vertex in a dataflow graph are
specified by the event that the vertex represents.

<p>
For example, vertex 1 in the graph represents execution of an event at agent
<code>u</code> specified by the 4-tuple: (1) the state before the event is
<code>u1</code>; (2) a single message is received in the event and the
message is <code>m1</code> from <code>v</code>; (3) the state after
the event is <code>u2</code>; (4) a single message <code>m3</code> is
sent in the event and this message is  sent to <code>v</code>.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Edges in Dataflow</h5>

The edges are in the same as in a timeline and are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>
There is an edge from an event at an agent to the next event at that
agent; this edge is labeled with the state of the agent between the
events and is called an <i>agent edge</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
There is an edge from an event in which a message is sent
to the edge at which the message is received; this edge is labeled
  with the message and is called a <i>message edge</i>.
  </li>
</ol>



  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Initial and Final States</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->


<p>
A dataflow graph starts in an initial state of the system.

A dataflow graph may be finite or infinite.

A dataflow graph has an initial vertex, labeled <i>O</i>, for each
agent.

The output edges from an initial vertex at an agent <code>u</code>
specify <code>u</code>'s initial state and the states of
<code>u</code>'s output channels.


<p>
The graph representing a finite execution of a system has a vertex labeled
<i>N</i> for each agent, representing the final state.

This vertex is called the final vertex of the agent.

The input edges to a final vertex at an agent <code>u</code>
specify <code>u</code>'s final state and the final states of
<code>u</code>'s input channels.

The initial and final vertices do not represent events.

<p>
A finite dataflow graph represents an execution of the system from the
initial state to the final state of the graph.


 
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Events and Steps</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------->

An agent can execute multiple receives specified by the same event.

An event is a 4-tuple that specifies a state transition of an agent.

Each execution of an event by an agent is called a <i>step</i> taken by the
agent to distinguish an execution of an event from the event itself.

Each vertex in a dataflow is a step taken by an agent.


 
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Time in Dataflow: Before and After</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------->
The only concept of time in a dataflow is that some steps occur before
other steps.

A message is sent <i>before</i> it is received.

Equivalently, a message is received <i>after</i> it is sent.

Later steps at an agent occur after earlier steps at the agent.

<i>before</i> and <i>after</i> are partial orders on steps in a dataflow.

<p>
A step \(v\) occurs before a step \(v'\) in a dataflow exactly when
there is a path from \(v\) to \(v'\).

For example, steps 0, 1 and 2 occur before step 3.

Likewise steps 4 and N occur after step 3.

Step 1 is neither before nor after step 2.



 
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Advantages and Disadvantages of the
  Dataflow Model</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

<p class="w3-text-teal">Disadvantages</p>
The obvious disadvantage of dataflow is that ignores time which can
play a role in ensuring that a system behaves correctly.

Moreover a model that doesn't deal with time cannot deal with
specifications that include time.

Also time plays a critical role in system performance.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Advantages</p>
Analyzing simpler models is easier than analyzing complex ones.

A single dataflow represents all timelines with the same flow
structure and arbitrary timing; so, a property of the dataflow is also
a property of all timelines that the dataflow represents.

We will prove properties of all dataflows of a system, and these
properties also hold for all timelines.

<p>
We use the simplest model adequate for the task at hand.
