<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines, Dataflow, and Computations</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A <i>timeline</i> shows how the state of a system changes over time.

  A <i>dataflow graph</i> is an abstraction of a timeline that
  represents the execution of each <code>receive</code> as
  a vertex.

  A <i>computation</i> is a topological sort of a dataflow graph.

  Dataflow graphs and computations are used throughout this website.

  </p>


  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->

  <p>
  An idle agent waits for messages to arrive on its input channels.

  An idle agent <code>v</code> executes <code>receive(msg, u)</code> by
  receiving <code>msg</code> at the head of any nonempty input channel
  <code>(u, v)</code>.

  An agent's variables change as it executes a <code>receive()</code>
  and the agent may send messages.

  <p>
  The evolution of the state of a system over time is depicted by a
  timeline 
  diagram in which the x-axis is the time axis or t-axis.

  Figure 1 shows states of a system with two agents \(u\) and
  \(v\).
  
  Each horizontal line shows the state of an agent at each point in
  time. 

  The lower horizontal line shows the states of agent v
  and the upper horizontal line shows the states of agent u.


    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>

  

<p>
An execution of a receive is represented by a rectangle, and
the length of the rectangle represents the time to execute the
  receive.

  The state of the agent changes as the receive is executed, and is
  specified at each point in the rectangle.


  <p>
  Each message is represented by a line which is labeled with the
message.

The line starts from the point on the sender's timeline at the time that the
message is sent.

The line ends at the point on the receiver's timeline at the time that the
receiver starts executing the <code>receive()</code> which receives
  the message.

  <p>
For example, messages m2 and m3 are sent by \(u\) while it is executing its
  first <code>receive</code>.
  Agent \(v\) starts executing <code>receive(m2, u)</code> some time
after v sends m2.

The state of v before it starts its <code>k</code>-th execution of receive is
shown in the figure as <code>vk</code>.


<p>
An instant at time T is represented by a vertical line T units to the
right of the origin.

The state of an agent at time T is the state where the vertical line
at T intersects the horizontal line representing the agent's state at
different points in time.

In the figure, at time T represented by the dotted red line, agents
<code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are both executing receives.




<p>
Next, we describe a model that ignores time and ignores changes in the
state of an agent while it is executing a <code>receive</code>.

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Events</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

The top diagram of the figure below depicts an execution of
<code>receive</code> as time progresses, and the lower diagram ignores
time and restricts attention to the states of the agent before and
after execution of the receive.

    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.002.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Representation of receive with and without time</figcaption>
</figure>

An execution of a <code>receive</code> by an agent
<code>u</code> is called an <i>event at <code>u</code></i>.

Ignoring the evolution of state over real time (upper diagram of
figure 2), we specify an event in which an agent <code>u</code> executes
  <code>receive(msg, v)</code> as the following 4-tuple (lower diagram of
figure 2):
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state before it executes the <code>receive</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
  the message, <code>msg</code>, received and the sender, <code>v</code>, of the message,
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state after it completes execution of the <code>receive</code>, and  
  </li>
  <li>
  for each output channel of <code>u</code>, the sequence of messages
  sent and the receivers of the messages.
  </li>
</ol>
The first two elements of the tuple are the <i>inputs to the event</i>, and
the last two elements are the <i>outputs of the event</i>.

<p>
Each event represents an execution of a receive but without specifying
the time evolution of state.
And each execution of a receive is represented by an event.

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->
A dataflow graph is an abstraction of the timeline diagram.

The lower diagram of figure 3 is the dataflow abstraction of the
timeline shown in the upper diagram.


  
    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.003.jpeg"
    alt="Fig3" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example: Dataflow Graph</figcaption>
</figure>


A dataflow graph of a system is a labeled, directed, acyclic graph
where the vertices represent events and the edges represent relations
between events.
There is an edge from an event at an agent to the next event at that
agent; this edge is labeled with the state of the agent between the
events and is called an <i>agent edge</i>.
There is an edge from an event in which a message is sent
to the edge at which the message is received; this edge is labeled
with the message and is called a <i>message edge</i>.

<p>
The inputs and outputs of each vertex in a dataflow graph are
as in the 4-tuple specification of the event that the vertex
represents.

For example, vertex 1 in the graph represents an event at agent
<code>u</code> specified by the 4-tuple: (1) state before event is
<code>u1</code>, (2) message received is <code>m1</code> from
<code>v</code>, (3) state after event is <code>u2</code>, (4) messages
sent in the event are <code>m3</code> sent to <code>v</code>.





  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Initial and Final States</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->


<p>
A dataflow graph starts in any state, and may be finite or infinite.

A dataflow graph has an initial vertex, labeled <i>O</i>, for each
agent.

The output edges from an initial vertex at an agent <code>u</code>
specify <code>u</code>'s initial state and the states of
<code>u</code>'s output channels.


<p>
The graph representing a finite computation has a vertex labeled
<i>N</i> for each agent, representing the final state.

This vertex is called the final vertex of the agent.

The input edges to a final vertex at an agent <code>u</code>
specify <code>u</code>'s final state and the final states of
<code>u</code>'s input channels.

The initial and final vertices do not represent events.


 
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computations</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

A computation of a system is a sequence of events in a dataflow graph
of the system where for every edge \((e, e')\) in the dataflow graph,
\(e\) appears before \(e'\) in the sequence.

So, a computation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
  topological sort</a> of a dataflow graph.

<p>
A computation is drawn as a dataflow graph with events earlier in the
sequence appearing to the left of later events.

Figure 4 shows computations \([1, 2, 3, 4]\) and \([2, 1, 3, 4]\) that
have the same dataflow.

  
    <figure>
    <img
    src="Model/Model.004.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example: Computations with the same Dataflow</figcaption>
</figure>

There can be more than one computation with the same dataflow graph,
as in figure 4.
The order in which vertices appear in a diagram doesn't change the graph, so each
computation represents exactly one dataflow graph.

<p>
A model for generating the sequence of events in a computation is the
following loop:

<pre>
while there exists a nonempty channel in the system:
   select a nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   v executes receive(msg, u)
</pre>


<p>

A message sent in some iteration of the while loop is received in some
future iteration.

The number of iterations after a message is sent until the message is
received is arbitrary but finite.

If a channel is nonempty at the start of an iteration then
that channel will be selected in that or future iteration.

<p>
The while loop is merely a model.
A distributed system is not implemented by a sequential while loop.

<!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Example</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->
The computation \([2, 1, 3, 4]\) shown in the lower diagram of figure
4 can be generated by selecting nonempty channels in the following
sequence: <code>(u, v)</code>, <code>(v, u)</code>, <code>(u,
v)</code>, <code>(v, u)</code>.


<!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Models and Reality</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->
The state of a system evolves over time.

Agents change local variables as they execute <code>receive</code>s.

Timelines are a diagrammatic representation of state evolution.

<p>

A dataflow graph is a model that ignores state evolution over time.

A computation is a restriction because it is inherently sequential --
at most one agent is executing a program while all others are idle.

<p>
You may wonder how models that ignore important features such as time
and parallel execution can be useful.

This website shows how simple models help in designing distributed
systems.
