  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Example: Tossing Balloons  (continued)</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="SimpleExample"></a>
  This example is a continuation from the example in
  <a href="BasicsStatesExamples.html">States</a>.

  
Two children, X and Y, are tossing balloons to each other.

A balloon that has been tossed by X, while in the air to Y, is a
message in the channel (X, Y\).

When a child gets a balloon it tosses the balloon back immediately.

Initially there is a balloon tossed by X on its way to Y and there is
also a balloon tossed by Y on its way to X.

<p>
  Each child has a countdown of the number of times it tosses balloons.

  Each time a child tosses a balloon it decrements its countdown value.

After a child's countdown reaches 0 the child pops balloons that it receives
(and doesn't toss popped balloons). 

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
  How is a state of this system specified?

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
The state of a channel is the number of balloons in it.

The state of an agent (X or Y) is the countdown value nX or nY,
  respectively.

  The state of the system is given by the states of its agents and channels.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
  What is an example of a computation of the system?

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
An example of a computation is
  shown in the diagrams below where the computation is State 1 to
  State 2 to .. State 6.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
Specify the computation which is shown above as a sequence of diagrams
as a sequence of states.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
The sequence of states, shown below, is the computation shown in the
diagrams above. You can verify that there exists a transition from
each state in the sequence to the next. Also see that each
transition is caused by exactly one agent receiving exactly one
message on one of the agent's input channels.


  <p>
  <i>Initial State</i>: Channel (X, Y) has one balloon and channel (Y, X) has 
  one balloon. And the countdown for X is 2 and the countdown for Y is
  3. We represent this state by:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1

  <p>
  The sequence of steps from the initial state are as follows.
  
<ol>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and  sends it back. So the state
  becomes
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
</ol>
There are no further steps in this computation.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
What are other transitions from the initial state of the computation?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
Let's look at the event in step 2 of the above computation. The event
is as follows.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Event: X receives a balloon for the first time</p>
This event is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  X's state before the event is nX = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message that is received is 1 (balloon) and the message is from
  Y. 
  </li>
  <li>
  X's state after the event is nX = 0
  <li>
  The message that is sent in the event is 1 (balloon) and the message is to
  Y. 
  </li>
</ol>

This event can be executed in any state S which satisfies the inputs
to this event:
<ol>
  <li>
  X's state before the event is nX = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message at the head of channel (Y, X) is 1. 
  </li>
</ol>

So, this event can be executed in the initial state.

<p>
The execution of this event causes a transition
from the initial state to a state shown in the following diagram:

<figcaption>Figure Another Transition from the Initial State
</figcaption>
</figure>


<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
Can you give examples of other computations starting in the same
state?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>

  <i>Initial State</i>: Channel (X, Y) has one balloon and channel (Y, X) has
  one balloon. And the countdown for X is 2 and the countdown for Y is
  3. We represent this state by:
  <br>
nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1


<ol>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes:
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 2, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and  sends it back. So the state
  becomes
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon sends it back. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
</ol>
There are no further steps in this computation.
<p>
Some states (e.g. State 2) in the first example of a computation don't occur in the
second example, and vice versa.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Invariants, Loop Variants and Termination in
the Simple Balloon Example</h3>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
Give an example of an invariant for the balloon example.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
An invariant of the system is:
<p>
Number of balloons is at most 2
<p>
which is equivalent to: <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X) <= 2</code>
<p>
(Here we are abusing notation using (X, Y) for a channel and also for
the state of the channel.)

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
How do you prove that this condition is invariant?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
To prove that this predicate (Boolean condition) is an invariant we
prove that (1) it holds initially 
and (2) and for all state transitions, if the invariant holds in the
state before the transition then it holds in the state after the transition.

<p>
Initially: <code>(X, Y) = 1</code> and <code>(Y, X) = 1</code>

So, the predicate holds initially.

<p>
A state transition in which a balloon is returned does not change the value
of <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X)</code>.

<p>
A state transition in which a balloon is popped decreases <code>(X, Y)
+ (Y, X)</code>.

<p>
Therefore if the predicate holds before a state
transition then it holds after the transition.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>

Is the following an invariant of the system?
<p>
((X, Y) + (Y, X) = 2) or (nX = 0) or (nY = 0)


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
Yes, this predicate is an invariant.

<p>
To prove that this predicate is an invariant we
prove that (1) it holds initially 
and (2) and for all state transitions, if the invariant holds in the
state before the transition then it holds in the state after the
transition.

<p>
Initially, <code>(X, Y) = 1</code> and <code>(Y, X) = 1</code>.

Therefore the predicate holds initially.


<p>
Let S be the state before a transition to a state S'.
We will prove that if the predicate holds in S then the predicate
holds in S'.

<p>
Consider two cases:
<ol>
  <li>
  nX = 0 or nY = 0 in S.
  <p>
  Because nX and nY do not increase,
  and nX and nY do not become negative,
  in the execution of an event, it follows that nX = 0 or nY = 0 in S'.
  Therefore the predicate holds in S'.
  </li>
  <li>
  nX > 0 and nY > 0 in S.
  <p>
  Because the invariant holds in S it follows that <code>(X, Y) + (Y,
  X) = 2</code> in S.
  <p>
  Because nY > 0 the execution of an event in which Y receives a
  balloon leaves <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X)</code> unchanged.
  <p>
  Because nX > 0 the execution of an event in which X receives a
  balloon leaves <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X)</code> unchanged.
  <p>
  Therefore <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X) = 2</code> in S'.
  So, the predicate holds in S'.
  </li>
</ol>





<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Example of a Loop Variant</h3>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
How do you prove that the algorithm terminates?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>
To prove that the algorithm terminates we use the loop variant:
<center>
<code>nX + nY + (X, Y) + (Y, X)</code>
</center>

<p>
The loop variant is a function of the state (i.e. variables) of the system.

In this example, the loop variant maps states of the program to
integers.

<p>
We must show that  (1) the loop variant is bounded below and we can
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation">carry
out induction</a> on the values of the loop variant, i.e., it can
decrease only a finite number of times before it reaches a lower
bound, and (2) the executions of all steps in all computations that
start at initial states reduce the value of the loop variant.

The specific lower bound is irrelevant for the proof of termination.

<p>
In this example, 0 is (obviously) a lower bound.

Next we show that the execution of any event in any state reduces the
value of the loop variant.

<p>
When Y receives a balloon if nY is positive then nY
decreases which the loop variant, and if nY is 0 then
(X, Y) which decreases the loop variant.
<p>
Similarly every event in which X receives a balloon also reduces the
loop variant. Thus the executions of all events reduce the loop variant.

<p>
Therefore the algorithm terminates execution.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h4>
What can you prove about the state of the system when the computation
terminates? 

We have shown that computations terminate and we given examples of
invariants.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h4>

<p>
At termination all channels are empty.

Let's prove that nX or nY is 0 at termination.

<p>
From the invariants if:
<br>
<code>(X, Y) + (Y, X)</code> \(\neq\) 2 then nX
or nY is 0.
<p>
At termination, <code>(X, Y) + (Y, X)</code> \(=\) 0, and the result follows.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">More Examples of Invariants and Loop Variants</h3>

  We reason about the correctness of many distributed algorithms in
  in the same way that we reason about sequential
  <code>while</code> loops, by using invariants and loop variants.




  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Example: GCD using a While Loop</h3>
  
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">
  loop invariant</a>
  is an assertion about the state of the program that holds before and
  after each iteration of the loop.

  You can look up

  <a
  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2112/2020fa/lectures/lecture.html?id=loopinv">
  many examples</a> of loop invariants on the web.


  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Example: Invariant</h5>
  
  A loop invariant in the following greatest common
  divisor (gcd) program is shown in the body of the loop as the
  assertion <code>gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)</code>.
  
    <pre>
x, y = X, Y
while x != y:
  # assertion: gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)
  if x > y: x = x - y
  else: y = y - x
  </pre>






  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Invariant of a Distributed System for GCD</h3>
  
  An invariant of a distributed system is a
  predicates that holds in all states reachable from initial states.

  An invariant of a distributed system is the loop invariant of the
  following while loop.

  An invariant <code>Inv</code> is shown
  as an assertion in the body of the loop.
  
  <pre>
while there exists a nonempty input channel in the system:
   # assertion: Inv
   select a nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   v executes receive(msg, u)
  </pre>



  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Example of a Distributed GCD</h5>
  
  We are given a strongly connected network of agents -- i.e.,
  there is a path from each agent to every other agent.

  Each agent has a local variable <code>n</code>, which is initialized
  as a positive integer.
  
  Let GCD be the gcd (greatest commond divisor) of the
  initial values of <code>X.n</code> of all agents <code>X.n</code>.

  The following distributed algorithm terminates and at termination
  <code>X.n = GCD</code> for all agents <code>X.n</code>.

In the code, <code>successors</code> is the list of successor agents
in a network of agents, and the agent only sends messages to its
successors. 

<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   if n != message:
      n = gcd(n, message)
      for successor in successors:
         send(n, successor)
</pre>

An invariant of the distributed algorithm is as follows.
The gcd of:
<br>
<i>all messages in channels and 
<code>X.n</code> for all agents <code>X</code></i>
<br>
is GCD.

  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
  
The proof that the assertion holds initially is trivial.

Prove that if the assertion holds before any event 
then it continues to hold after the event.

<p>
Let the event be agent <code>A</code> receiving a message
<code>m</code>.
After the event, <code>m</code> is no longer in the channel;
<code>n = gcd(n, m)</code>; and messages with the new value of
<code>n</code> are in the output channels from <code>A</code>.
The proof that the assertion continues to hold in the post-event state
is straightforward.


  <!----------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Example of an Invariant</h5>

Another invariant for the gcd example, given earlier, is as follows.
For all channels <code>(X, Y)</code> in the network:
<ol>
  <li>
  Channel <code>(X, Y)</code> is empty and <code>X.n</code> is a
  multiple of <code>Y.n</code>, or
  </li>
  <li>
  The last message in channel <code>(X, Y)</code> is <code>m</code>
  where <code>m = X.n</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
  
The assertion holds initially because the second condition holds. 

Prove that if the assertion holds before any event
then it continues to hold after the event.

<p>
When agent <code>X</code> executes a receive that changes
<code>X.n</code> the agent sends a message <code>m</code> to
<code>Y</code> where <code>m = X.n</code>, and so the second condition
holds.

<p>
When agent <code>Y</code> receives <code>m</code> the agent sets
<code>Y.n = gcd(Y.n, m)</code>, and so <code>m</code> is a multiple of
the new value of <code>Y.n</code>.

If channel <code>(X, Y)</code> remains nonempty then the second
condition holds.

If <code>(X, Y)</code> becomes empty then the first condition holds
because <code>m = X.n</code> and <code>m</code> is a multiple of
<code>Y.n</code>.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Loop Variant</h3>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Question about Loop Variant in the Sequential
GCD</h3>
What is an example of a loop variant for the following loop?
    <pre>
x, y = X, Y
while x != y:
  # assertion: gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)
  if x > y: x = x - y
  else: y = y - x
  </pre>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
<code>f(x, y) = x + y</code> is an example of a loop variant for the
following reasons.
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>f</code> is a function of the state of the program.
  </li>
  <li>
<code>f</code> has integer values.
  </li>
  <li>
<code>f</code> is bounded below. The bound is 2 because <code>x</code>
  and <code>y</code> are bounded below because of the invariants
  <code>x</code> \(\geq\) 1, and <code>y</code> \(\geq\) 1.
  The precise bounds don't matter.
  </li>
  <li>
  Each execution of the loop decreases <code>f</code>.
</ol>
We can carry out an induction on <code>f</code> because <code>f</code>
has integer values and is bounded below.



<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Question about Loop Variants in Distributed Algorithms</h4>
Let's look at the example of the distributed algorithm given
earlier? The example is repeated below.

<p>
  
  We are given a strongly connected network of agents -- i.e.,
  there is a path from each agent to every other agent.

  Each agent has a local variable <code>n</code>, which is initialized
  as a positive integer.
  
  Let GCD be the gcd (greatest commond divisor) of the
  initial values of <code>X.n</code> of all agents <code>X.n</code>.

In the code, <code>successors</code> is the list of successor agents
in a network of agents, and the agent only sends messages to its

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h5>
What is an example of a loop variant for the distributed algorithm?

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h5>
Let <code>f</code> be the tuple <code>(N, M)</code> where
<code>N</code> is the sum of <code>X.n</code> for all agents
<code>X</code>, and <code>M</code> is the total number of messages in
channels.

<p>
Comparisons of tuples are made lexicographically.

For example (2, 1) > (1, 10), and (2, 1) < (2, 2).

<p>
<code>f</code> is bounded below by (0, 0).

<p>
An induction can be carried out on a tuple of integers.

Next we show that the execution of each event reduces <code>f</code>.

<p>
When an agent <code>X</code> receives a message <code>m</code>, 

<ol>
  <li>
  if <code>X.n</code> \(\neq\) <code>m</code> then <code>X.n</code>
  becomes <code>gcd(X.n, m)</code>, and so the new value of
  <code>X.n</code> is less than its previous value, and so execution
  of the event decreases <code>N</code> which decreases <code>f</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  if <code>X.n</code> \(=\) <code>m</code> then the event removes
  message <code>m</code> from a channel and does not add messages to
  channels. So the event decreases <code>M</code> which decreases
  <code>f</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Condition of a While Loop</h3>
What can we say about the state at termination of the while loop in
the gcd example:

    <pre>
x, y = X, Y
while x != y:
  # assertion: gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)
  if x > y: x = x - y
  else: y = y - x
  </pre>

The while loop terminates when <code>x = y</code>.
From the invariant, at termination:
<pre>
gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, x) = x = gcd(X, Y)
</pre>
Therefore <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <code>gcd(X, Y)</code>
at termination of the while loop.

  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Condition of a Distributed Algorithm</h3>

What is the termination condition of the distributed gcd algorithm in
which the <code>receive</code> of each agent is as follows?
<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   if n != message:
      n = gcd(n, message)
      for successor in successors:
         send(n, successor)
</pre>

At termination all channels are empty.

From the invariant, if channel (X, Y) is empty then X.n is a multiple
of Y.n.

<p>
Therefore when all channels are empty, for every channel (X, Y) in the
system X.n is a multiple of Y.n.

Because the directed graph of agents and edges specified as
<code>successors</code> of agents is strongly
connected:
<p>
<i> for all agents X, Y in the system: X.n is a multiple of Y.n</i>

<p>
Therefore X.n = Y.n for all agents X, Y.
From the invariant, X.n is GCD.
