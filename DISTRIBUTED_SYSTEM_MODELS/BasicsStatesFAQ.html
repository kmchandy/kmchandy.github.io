    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">States: FAQ</h1>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Exactly what is a state?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
The future behavior of a system, given its state, is independent of
  the past behavior of the system.

  A system may enter the same state by executing different behaviors,
  but the future behavior of a system, given its state, doesn't depend
  on what happened before the state was entered.

  See a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">
  comprehensive description of states in computer
  systems.</a>
  
  

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Don't agents change states continuously?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  Yes, agent states may change continuously.
  
  The complete state of an agent includes its program counter which
  points to the next statement to be executed by the agent.

  Our model ignores continuous changes in state of an agent while it
  is executing a <code>receive</code> and restricts
  attention to the state of an agent when it is waiting.

  <p>
  In our model, an agent is waiting for a message or processing a
  message that it received.

  We only deal with the state of the agent after it has finished
  processing the message and is back in the waiting state.

  The changes that occur while a <code>receive</code> is being
  executed are ignored by the model.

  

  
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">What happens if an agent goes to sleep
  during a <code>receive</code>? </p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  An example that helps to answer this question is as follows.
  <pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   send ("hello", receiver_1)
   time.sleep(1000)
   send ("world", receiver_2)
  </pre>

  The agent sends a message "hello" to <code>receiver_1</code> then sleeps for
  1000 seconds and then sends a message to <code>receiver_2</code>.

  We may expect enough time to elapse between the messages to allow
  <code>receiver_1</code> to send a message to <code>receiver_2</code>
  before the "world" message gets to <code>receiver_2</code>.

  <p>
  Our model does not deal with time.
  It treats the execution of the <code>receive</code> as an atomic
  operation.

  The effect of the following <code>receive</code> with the
  <code>sleep</code> removed is the same as the previous
<code>receive</code>.

<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   send ("hello", receiver_1)
   send ("world", receiver_2)
  </pre>

Time is important in the behavior of distributed systems.

We don't use time in reasoning about the correctness of distributed
systems because it's safer not to depend on clock accuracy.

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can two agents receive messages at exactly
  the same time? Won't that result in a state transition in which two
  agents change state?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
If two agents receive messages at exactly the same time then the
  events at which the messages are received are independent and so
they can be executed in arbitrary order.

<p>
Suppose agent \(v\) receives a message \(m\) from agent \(u\) at exactly the
same time that \(u\) receives a message \(m'\) from \(v\).

Then before the steps, the channel from \(v\) to \(u\) contained
message \(m\) and the channel from \(u\) to \(v\) contained
message \(m'\).

<p>
If \(u\) receives \(m'\) first it makes no difference to \(m\) being
at the head of the channel from \(v\) to \(u\).
So, the order in which the steps occur is irrelevant.

<p>
Many agents are changing state and sending and receiving messages
concurrently.

We ignore these concurrent changes and restrict attention state
changes in which one agent receives one message.

We can analyze systems with concurrent changes using our simple model.



  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent receive multiple messages in a
  single state transition? Can an agent send multiple messages to
  another agent in a single state transition?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

Our model only allows one message to be received in a state transition
and one message to be sent to an agent in the transition.

<p>
Extending the model to allow a sequence of messages to be sent to an
agent in a single transition isn't necessary for the algorithms that
we discuss; however, extending the model to do so is straightforward
and you should try to do so.

<p>
The model does not fully capture reality.

A model is an engineering choice. It is an abstraction of reality that
helps us develop algorithms.
