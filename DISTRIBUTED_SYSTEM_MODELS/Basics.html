  This page describes a simple model and notation for distributed
  algorithms.

  The model is adequate for describing a collection of algorithms.

  Other models are introduced later.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Models of Distributed Systems</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  Distributed systems are complex.

  A banking information system supports actions
  in ATM machines, branch offices, and fraud analysis centers.

  An earthquake monitoring system has thousands of sensors and agents
  carrying out complex calculations.
  
<p>
  
  A model of a distributed system is an abstraction that ignores some
  features.

  Different models are used to design algorithms in different
  settings;

  for example, a model of a system in which messages may be
  corrupted is different from one in which messages are incorruptible.


  <p>
  We begin with a simple model and notation.
  Examples of some distributed algorithms are given in Python using a
  simulator and using software libraries such as a
  <a
  href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
  Python implementation</a>
  of the
  <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">
  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
  </a>

  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Model: A Network of Agents and Channels</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>

A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
channels.
  
  A channel is directed from one agent to one agent.

  A channel from an agent <code>P</code> to an agent <code>Q</code> is
called an output of <code>P</code> and an input of <code>Q</code>.

The ordered pair <code>(P, Q)</code> represents the channel from
<code>P</code> to <code>Q</code>.
  
  An agent can send messages on its output channels and receive
  messages on its input channels.

<p>
A system is represented by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">
directed graph
</a> in which vertices
represent agents and edges represent channels.
The graph is called a <i>network of agents.</i>

<p>
Figure 1 shows a network of 4 agents: <code>pos</code>,
<code>neg</code>, <code>sum</code>, and <code>result</code>.

The network has 3 edges: <code>(pos, sum)</code>, <code>(neg, sum)</code>,
and <code>(sum, result)</code>.

    src="DistributedSystemModels.020.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:60%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Agent Network of the Example</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
A distributed system is initiated with sets of agents and channels
  that remain unchanged. 

Agents and channels are not created or deleted during a computation.



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Message Communication: Channels</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

The state of a channel is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">
queue</a> consisting of the sequence of
messages in the channel -- these are the messages that have been sent
on the channel and that have not been received.

<p>
An agent sends a message by appending the message to the tail (rear)
of the queue.

A message from a nonempty queue is delivered to an agent by removing
the message from the head (front) of the queue, and calling the
<code>receive</code> function of the agent.

<p>
Messages are not lost or modified in channels.
Every message sent is received.
Message delays are arbitrary (but finite).

<p>
A system has the following property: For all \(n\),
the \(n\)-th message received on a channel is the \(n\)-th message
sent on the channel, and the \(n\)-th message is received on a channel
only after the \(n\)-th message is sent on the channel.


<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
An agent is an object that sends and receives messages.

An agent is a sequential program that has two parts:
(1) a part that initializes
variables and output channels of the agent and
(2) a function
<pre>
receive(message, sender)
</pre>
called a callback function in
<a href=
"https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
message queuing libraries.
</a>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Delivering a message in a channel to an agent</p>
If an agent has a nonempty input channel then the <code>receive</code>
function of the agent is called where <code>message</code> is the
message at the head of the channel and <code>sender</code> is the
agent that sent the message.

The message at the channel head is removed and processed by the agent.


<p>
A <code>receive</code> function must not be recursive: an agent cannot
receive a new message while it is executing a receive on a previous
message. 

Every execution of <code>receive</code> must terminate.

<p>
An agent may have many nonempty input channels but the agent processes
only one message at a time. An agent is not interrupted while it
is executing a <code>receive</code>. Messages that arrive while an
agent is executing a <code>receive</code> remain in channels.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Sending a message on a channel by an agent</p>
An agent sends a message by executing
<pre>
send(message, receiver)
</pre>
The first parameter of <code>send</code> is the message that is sent,
and the second paramenter is the agent to which the message is sent.

Execution of this statement places the message in the output channel
directed from the sender to the receiver.

Statements that send messages appear in the <code>receive</code>
function of the agent.

An agent sends messages in response to messages that it receives.


See <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES">examples</a>.



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The State of a System</h4>
The state of a system is given by the states of its agents and
channels.

We represent a system state as a tuple with an element of the tuple
for each agent and each channel.

<p>
The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables
(including its <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter"> program
counter</a>).

An agent's state changes while it executes its <code>receive</code>
function.

An agent's state remains unchanged while it is idle, waiting to
execute a <code>receive</code>.

<p>
The state of a channel is the sequence of messages sent on the channel
that have not as yet been delivered, and the channel state changes when a message is
sent on the channel or a message in the channel is delivered.



<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>

This is an example of an agent, <code>sum_pos_neg</code>,
that receives messages from agents
<code>pos</code> and <code>neg</code>,
and sends messages to agent <code>results</code>.

See an <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/SumPosAndNeg.py">example</a>
of an implementation in Python.

<p>

The statements before the <code>receive</code> function specify the
initial values of variables and output channels of the agent.

The initial state of an output channel is an empty queue unless it is assigned
a different value.

In this example, the initial state is <code>sum = 0</code> and the
agent's output channels are empty initially.




<pre>
# Initialization
sum = 0

# Callback function
def receive(message, sender):
   if sender == pos:
       sum = sum + message
   else:
       sum = sum - message
   send(sum, results)
</pre>

If the agent receives a message from agent <code>pos</code> then the
agent increments <code>sum</code> by the contents of the message and sends the
resulting value of <code>sum</code> to the agent <code>results</code>.

The agent takes similar actions when it receives a message from
<code>neg</code> except that it decrements <code>sum</code>.
