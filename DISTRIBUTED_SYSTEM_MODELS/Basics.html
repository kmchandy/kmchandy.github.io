  This page describes a simple model for distributed
  algorithms.

  The model, though simple, is adequate for designing many
  algorithms.

  More models are introduced when needed.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Models of Distributed Systems</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  <!---------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Complex Systems and Simple Models</p>

  Distributed systems are complex.

  The information system that supports a bank supports actions taking place
  in ATM machines, branch offices, and fraud analysis centers.

  An earthquake monitoring system has thousands of sensors and agents
  connected to sensors and in the cloud.
  
<p>
  
  A model of a distributed system is an abstraction that ignores some
  features of systems while retaining others.

  Different models are used to design algorithms in different
  settings.

  A model of a system in which messages may be
  corrupted is different from one in which messages
  cannot be corrupted.

  We begin with a very simple model, identify its limitations, and show why
  it is useful. 



  <!---------------------------------------->  
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Notations</p>

 Languages and software libraries for implementing distributed systems
  have many features because distributed systems are complex.

The algorithms in this course deal with only a few key problems in
  distributed computing.

  We use a message queuing notation to describe algorithms:
  a message is appended to the tail of a queue and removed from its head.

 We give examples of implementations of the algorithms using libraries such as 
  <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">
  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
</a>,
and 
  <a
  href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
  a Python implementation of AMQP.
</a>




  
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Model: Agents and Channels</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>

A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
channels.
  
  A channel is directed from one agent to one agent.

  A channel from an agent <code>P</code> to an agent <code>Q</code> is
  an output of <code>P</code> and an input of <code>Q</code>.
  
  An agent can send messages on its output channels and receive
  messages on its input channels.

A system is represented by a directed graph in which vertices
represent agents and edges represent channels.

<p>
A distributed system is initiated with sets of agents and channels
  that remain unchanged. 

Agents and channels are not created or deleted.


  <h4 style="color:red;">Example: Agent-Channel Graph</h4>
  The figure below shows an agent-channel graph with agents \(A, B, C\).

    <figure>
    <img
    src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.001.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:60%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: An Agent Graph</figcaption>
    </figure>



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Message Communication: Channels</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

The state of a channel is the sequence of messages in the channel --
these are the messages that have been sent on the
channel and that have not been received.

An agent sends a message by appending the message to the tail of the
sequence of messages in the channel.

An agent can receive the message at the head of a nonempty sequence of
messages in any of the agent's input channels.

When an agent receives a message it is deleted from the sequence.

<p>
Associated with each channel is its initial state -- the sequence of
messages in the channel when the distributed system starts executing.


<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------->

Associated with each agent is (1) a program that initializes the
variables of the agent and (2) a function 
<pre>
receive(message, sender)
</pre>
called a callback function in
<a href=
"https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
message queuing libraries.
</a>
The parameters <code>message</code> and <code>sender</code> of the function are the
message that is received, and the sender of the message.

If an agent has a nonempty input channel then the <code>receive</code>
function of the agent is called where <code>message</code> is the
message at the head of the channel and <code>sender</code> is the
agent that sent the message;

the message is removed from the channel.



<p>
An agent sends a mesage by executing
<pre>
send(message, receiver)
</pre>
The first parameter of <code>send</code> is the message that is sent,
and the second paramenter is the agent to which the message is sent.

Execution of this statement places the message in the output channel
directed from the sender to the receiver.

A message can be sent on a channel independent of the state of the
channel.

An agent is never blocked from sending a message.

<p>
The website has <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES">examples of implementations.</a>

<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>
This is an example of an agent that receives messages from agents
<code>pos</code> and <code>neg</code>,
and sends messages to agent <code>results</code>.
The state of the agent is given by the values of its local variable
<code>sum</code> and its program counter.
<pre>
// Initial state
sum = 0

def receive(message, sender):
   if sender == pos:
       sum = sum + message
   else:
       sum = sum - message
   send(sum, results)
</pre>

<p>
See <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/SumPosAndNeg.py"> an example of an
implementation in Python.</a>
The implementation is a simple simulation of a distributed system.
Implementations with multiple processes using
<a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">
  AMQP
</a>
are given later.

<!----------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Restrictions on Agents</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------->

An agent can only access that agent's variables, send
messages only on that agent's output channels, and receive messages
only on that agent's input channels.

A <code>receive</code> function must not call itself, and every
execution of <code>receive</code> must terminate.
