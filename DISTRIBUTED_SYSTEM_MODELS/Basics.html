<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes a simple model and notation for distributed
  algorithms.

  The model is adequate for describing a collection of algorithms.

  Other models are introduced later.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  Distributed systems are complex.

  A banking information system supports actions
  in ATM machines, branch offices, and fraud analysis centers.

  An earthquake monitoring system has thousands of sensors and agents
  carrying out complex calculations.

  A model of a distributed system is an abstraction that ignores some
  features.

  The choice of a model is an engineering decision: We work with
  a model that is adequate to solve our problem.

  Different models are used to design algorithms in different
  settings;

  for example, a model of a system in which messages may be
  corrupted is different from one in which messages are incorruptible.


  <p>
  We begin with a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
  simple actor model and notation</a>.

  The model and its mathematical properties are critical for
  describing and proving the correctness of algorithms;
  the programming notation is not important but is necessary to
  provide examples.
  Examples of some distributed algorithms are given in Python using a
  simulator and using software libraries such as a
  <a
  href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
  Python implementation</a>
  of the

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Model: A Network of Agents and Channels</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>

A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
channels.

A channel is directed from exactly one agent to exactly one agent.

<p>
The ordered pair <code>(P, Q)</code> represents the channel directed from
<code>P</code> to <code>Q</code>.

A channel <code>(P, Q)</code> is
called an <i>output</i> of <code>P</code> and an <i>input</i> of
<code>Q</code>.

An agent can send messages on its output channels and receive
messages on its input channels.

The <i>sender</i> and <i>receiver</i> of a channel <code>(P, Q)</code> are
<code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, respectively.

<p>
The system has a channel <code>(P, Q)</code> for all agents
<code>P</code>, <code>Q</code> of the system. 

There is a channel from each agent to itself

So, if there are \(N\) agents then there are \(N^{2}\) channels.

An agent can send messages to any agent including itself.

In almost all algorithms described in this course very few of the
\(N^{2}\) channels are used.

<p>
A distributed system is initiated with sets of agents and channels
  that remain unchanged. 

Agents and channels are not created or deleted during a computation.


<a name="Channels"></a>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Message Communication: Channels</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

The state of a channel is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">
queue</a> consisting of the sequence of
messages in the channel -- these are the messages that have been sent
on the channel and that have not been received.

<p>
An agent sends a message by appending the message to the tail (rear)
of the queue.

A message from a nonempty queue is delivered to an agent by removing
the message from the head (front) of the queue, and calling a function
of the agent.

<p>
Messages are not lost or modified in channels.
Every message sent is received.
Message delays are arbitrary.

<p>
Channels have the following properties:
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Messages are delivered in the order sent.</i>
  <p>
  For all \(n\), the \(n\)-th message received on a channel is the
  \(n\)-th message sent on the channel.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A message is received only after it is sent.</i>
  <p>
  The \(n\)-th message is received on a channel only after the
  \(n\)-th message is sent on the channel.
  </li>
</ol>

There is no limit to the size of the queue of messages in a channel.

An agent can append a message to a channel independent of the size of
the channel.

<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Messages Sent on Different Channels may be
Delivered out of Order</h6>
Messages sent on the same channel are delivered in the order sent.
Messages sent on <i>different</i> channels may not be delivered in the
order sent.

<p>
The following scenario is possible with different agents \(A, B, C\).

<ol>
  <li>
  \(A\) sends message \(m_{1}\) to \(C\).
  </li>
  <li>
  Then \(A\) sends message \(m_{2}\) to \(B\).
  <li>
  When \(B\) receives \(m_{2}\), \(B\) sends a message \(m_{3}\) to
  \(C\).
  </li>
  <li>
  \(C\) receives \(m_{3}\) before \(C\) receives \(m_{2}\).
  </li>
</ol>
In the example, message \(m_{3}\) is sent to \(C\) after message
\(m_{1}\) is sent to \(C\), but \(C\) receives \(m_{3}\) before
  \(m_{1}\). 


<a name="Agents"></a>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
An agent is an object that sends and receives messages.

An agent is either waiting to receive a message or is processing a
message that it has received.

An agent that is waiting starts processing a message when the agent
receives a message.

An agent that is processing a message transitions to the waiting state
when the agent finishes processing the message.

<p>
Each agent has a set of variables.

An agent's variables are local to the agent -- they cannot be accessed
by other agents.

The state of an agent is specified by the values of its variables.
<p>
An agent is specified by (1) a program that initializes the agent's
variables and (2) a function

<pre>
receive(message, sender)
</pre>
called a callback function in
<a href=
"https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
message queuing libraries.
</a>

<p>
If a waiting agent <code>u</code> has a nonempty input channel then the
system selects <i>any</i> nonempty channel <code>(v, u)</code>, 
removes the message <code>m</code> at the head of the channel from the channel, and calls 
the <code>receive(message, sender)</code> function of <code>u</code>
where <code>message</code> is <code>m</code> and <code>sender</code>
is <code>v</code>.


<p>
A <code>receive</code> function must not be recursive: an agent cannot
receive a new message while it is executing a receive on a previous
message.

Every execution of <code>receive</code> must terminate.

<p>
An agent may have many nonempty input channels but the agent processes
only one message at a time. An agent is not interrupted while it
is executing a <code>receive</code>. Messages that arrive while an
agent is executing a <code>receive</code> remain in channels.

<p>
After an agent completes execution of a <code>receive</code> the agent
returns to waiting state.


<p>
An agent may send messages in its <code>receive</code> function.
An agent sends a message by executing
<pre>
send(message, receiver)
</pre>
The first parameter of <code>send</code> is the message that is sent,
and the second paramenter is the agent to which the message is sent.

Execution of this statement places the message in the output channel
directed from the sender to the receiver.


<p>
See <a href="BasicsExamples">examples</a> and see
<a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/">examples of code</a>


The remainder of this page consists of an example.

<a name="Example"></a>
<!----------------------------------------------->
<center>
<h2 style="color:red;">Examples</h2>
</center>

<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of a System</h4>
A system consists of 4 agents, <code>pos</code>, <code>neg</code>,
<code>total</code>, and <code>X</code>, and the channels between
them. See "Figure Agents and Channels."

In this example, only 5 of the 16 channels are used.

The channels that are used are
<code>(pos, pos)</code>,
<code>(neg, neg)</code>,
<code>(pos, total)</code>,
<code>(neg, total)</code>, and
<code>(total, X)</code>.

<p>
The flow of messages is shown by a directed graph in which vertices
represent agents and the directed edges represent the channels that
are used.

  
    <figure>
    <img
    src="Basics_Diagram.005.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Figure Agents and Channels</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The system is started by specifying agents and initial channel states
and then starting the system.

In this example there is a message "wakeup" in the channel from
<code>pos</code> to itself and from <code>neg</code> to itself.

All other channels are empty.



<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>

This is an example of an agent, <code>total</code>,
that receives messages from agents
<code>pos</code> and <code>neg</code>,
and sends messages to agent <code>X</code>.

See an <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/SumPosAndNeg.py">example
of an implementation in Python using an Agent class.</a>

The example below does not use classes so that the algorithm is easier
to understand by readers who are not familiar with Python.

<p>

The statements before the <code>receive</code> function specify the
initial values of variables.

In this example, the initial state of <code>total</code> is given by
<code>sum = 0</code>. 


<pre>
# Initialization
sum = 0

# Callback function
def receive(message, sender):
   if sender == pos:
       sum = sum + message
   else:
       sum = sum - message
       if sum < 0: sum = 0
   send(sum, X)
</pre>

If the agent receives a message from agent <code>pos</code> then the
agent increments <code>sum</code> by the contents of the message.

If the agent receives a message from
<code>neg</code> the agent decrements <code>sum</code> by the
contents of the message, and if the resulting value of
<code>sum</code> is negative then <code>sum</code> is set to 0.

<p>
The agent sends the
resulting value of <code>sum</code> to the agent <code>X</code>.


<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>
This agent sends <code>my_data[n]</code> to agent <code>total</code>
for each element in <code>my_data</code>.

<pre>
# Initial values of agent's variables.
my_data = [3, 5]
n = 0


# Callback function
def receive(message, sender):
   send(message=my_data[n], receiver=total)
   n = n + 1
   if n < len(my_data):
      send(message="wakeup", receiver=pos)
</pre>


The agent has variables <code>my_data</code> and <code>n</code>
which are initially <code>[3, 5]</code> and <code>0</code>,
respectively. 

<p>
When <code>pos</code> receives a message it sends
<code>my_data[n]</code> to the agent <code>total</code> and then
increments <code>n</code>.

If <code>n</code> is less than the number of elements in
<code>my_data</code> then <code>pos</code> sends itself a wakeup message.

<p>
The system is initialized with a message in the channel from
<code>pos</code>  to itself.

When <code>pos</code> receives the message it sends
<code>my_data[0]</code> to agent <code>total</code>,
increments <code>n</code> to 1
and <code>pos</code> sends a message to itself, and

<p>
When <code>pos</code> receives the next message it sends
<code>my_data[1]</code> to agent <code>total</code>,
increments <code>n</code> to 2 and then waits.

<p>
So <code>pos</code> sends 3 and then 5 to <code>total</code> and then
<code>pos</code> waits forever.

<p>
Agent <code>neg</code> is identical to <code>pos</code> except that it
may have different values of <code>my_data</code>.

<p>
Agent <code>X</code> has no variables. It merely prints
messages that it receives.
