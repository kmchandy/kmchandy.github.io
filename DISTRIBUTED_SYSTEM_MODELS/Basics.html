<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes a simple model and notation for distributed
  algorithms.

  The model is adequate for describing a collection of algorithms.

  Other models are introduced later.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction</h4>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  Distributed systems are complex.

  A banking information system supports actions
  in ATM machines, branch offices, and fraud analysis centers.

  An earthquake monitoring system has thousands of sensors and agents
  carrying out complex calculations.

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Models</p>

  <p> A model of a system is an abstraction of the system.

    A model ignores some features of the system and retains features
    that are necessary to solve the problem at hand.

    The choice of a model is an engineering decision: We choose a
    model that is adequate to solve our problem.

    Different models are used to design algorithms in different
    settings; for example, a model of a system in which messages may
    be corrupted is different from one in which messages are
  incorruptible.

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Notation</p>
    <p>
    The model and its mathematical properties are critical for
  describing and proving the correctness of algorithms;
  a programming notation is not important.
  We need a notation, however, to provide examples.
  Examples of some algorithms are given in Python using a
  simulator of distributed systems and also by using software
    libraries such as a 
  <a
  href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
  Python implementation</a>
  of the
  <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">
  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Model: A Network of Agents and Channels</h4>
      <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
      <p>
  We begin with a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
      simple <i>actor</i> model and notation</a>.
      We call this model the <i>simple model</i>.

</p>

<p>
In the simple model, a distributed system consists of a set of agents
and a set of channels.  A channel is directed from exactly one agent
to exactly one agent.  The network of agents and channels that
constitute a distributed system can be represented by a directed graph
in which the vertices represent agents and the directed edges
represent channels.
</p>



<p>
A distributed system is initiated with sets of agents and channels
  that remain unchanged.  Agents and channels are not created or
  deleted during a computation.
</p>


  <!--------------START SECTION: Channels ---------------------->
  <div id="SECTION", class="Channels">
<a name="Channels"></a>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Message Communication: Channels</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
    In the simple model, a channel is directed from exactly one agent
    to exactly one agent.
    A channel from an agent <code>P</code> to an agent <code>Q</code>
    is represented by the ordered pair <code>(P, Q)</code>.
    In the simple model, there exists at most one channel from an
    agent <code>P</code> to an agent <code>Q</code>.
    There are models that allow more than one channel from one agent
    to another; however, for the time being we restrict ourselves to
    the simple model.
    </p>

    <p>
    A channel <code>(P, Q)</code> is called an <i>output</i> of agent
    <code>P</code> and an <i>input</i> of agent <code>Q</code>.
    The <i>sender</i> and <i>receiver</i> of a channel <code>(P,
    Q)</code> are <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, respectively.
    An agent can send messages only on its output channels and receive
    messages only on its input channels. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The <i>state of a channel</i> is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">
    queue</a> of messages -- these are the messages that have been sent
    on the channel and that have not been received.
    </p>

    <p>
    An agent sends a message on a channel by appending the message to
    the tail of the queue of messages in transit along the
    channel.
    A message from a nonempty channel is delivered to an agent by
    removing the message from the head of the queue of
    messages in the channel, and passing the message to the agent.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the simple model, channels have unlimited capacity.
    The queue that represents the state of a channel has unbounded size.
    A sender is never blocked from sending messages on a channel.
    </p>

    <p>
    Messages sent on the same channel are delivered in the order
sent.
If an agent <code>P</code> sends a message <code>M1</code> on a
    channel <code>(P, Q)</code>, and later sends a message
    <code>M2</code> on the same channel, then agent <code>Q</code>
    receives <code>M1</code> on channel <code>(P, Q)</code> before
    <code>Q</code> receives <code>M2</code> on the channel.



<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Messages Sent on Different Channels may be
Delivered out of Order</h6>
Messages sent on the same channel are delivered in the order sent.
Messages sent on <i>different</i> channels may not be delivered in the
order sent.

<p>
The following scenario is possible with different agents \(A, B, C\).
</p>


<ol>
  <li>
  \(A\) sends message \(m_{1}\) to \(C\).
  </li>
  <li>
  Then \(A\) sends message \(m_{2}\) to \(B\).
  <li>
  When \(B\) receives \(m_{2}\), \(B\) sends a message \(m_{3}\) to
  \(C\).
  </li>
  <li>
  \(C\) receives \(m_{3}\) before \(C\) receives \(m_{1}\).
  </li>
</ol>
In the example, message \(m_{3}\) is sent to \(C\) <i>after</i> message
\(m_{1}\) is sent to \(C\), but \(C\) receives \(m_{3}\) <i>before</i>
\(m_{1}\).
This can happen because \(m_{3}\) is sent on channel \((B, C)\)
  whereas \(m_{1}\) is sent on a <i>different</i> channel \((A, C)\).

<!--------------START SECTION: Agents ---------------------->
<div id="SECTION", class="Agents">
<a name="Agents"></a>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<p>
An agent is an object that sends and receives messages.
An agent is either waiting to receive a message or is processing a
message that it has received.
An agent that is waiting starts processing a message when the agent
receives a message.
When an agent finishes processing a message the agent waits for the next
message to be delivered to it.
</p>

<p>
Each agent has a set of variables.
An agent's variables are local to the agent -- they cannot be accessed
by other agents.
</p>


<p>
An agent is specified by (1) a program that initializes the agent's
variables and (2) a function
<pre>
receive(message, sender)
</pre>
called a callback function in
<a href=
"https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html">
message queuing libraries.
  </a>
  </p>

<p>
If the system has a waiting agent <code>u</code> with a nonempty
input channel <code>(v, u)</code> then the system may
remove the message <code>m</code> at the head of  
 <code>(v, u)</code>, and call
the <code>receive(message, sender)</code> function of <code>u</code>
where <code>message</code> is <code>m</code> and <code>sender</code>
is <code>v</code>.
</p>

  <p>
  In the simple model, an agent does not choose the channel from which
  the agent receives its  next message.
  The system chooses <i>any</i> nonempty channel from which it delivers a
  message to the receiver of that channel, and this choice is arbitrary.
  A waiting agent cannot refuse to accept a message.
</p>


  <p>
  A <code>receive</code> function must not be recursive: an agent cannot
  receive a new message while it is processing a message.
  Every execution of <code>receive</code> must terminate.
  An agent is not interrupted while it is executing a
  <code>receive</code>. 
</p>

<p>
An agent may have many nonempty input channels but the agent processes
only one message at a time.  Messages that arrive while an
agent is executing a <code>receive</code> remain in channels.
After an agent completes execution of a <code>receive</code> the agent
returns to waiting state.
</p>


<p>
An agent may send messages in its <code>receive</code> function.
An agent sends a message by executing
<pre>
send(message, receiver)
</pre>
The first parameter of <code>send</code> is the message that is sent,
and the second paramenter is the agent to which the message is sent.
Execution of this statement places the message in the output channel
directed from the sender to the receiver.
</p>

<p>
An agent in a distributed system is also called a <i>process</i> in
some books.
We use the term agent throughout these notes.

<h4 style="color:red;">Example of a System</h4>
A system consists of 4 agents, <code>pos</code>, <code>neg</code>,
<code>total</code>, and <code>X</code>, and the channels between
them. See "Figure Agents and Channels" which shows the network of
agents and channels represented as a directed graph.

<p>
The channels in the system are
<code>(pos, pos)</code>,
<code>(neg, neg)</code>,
<code>(pos, total)</code>,
<code>(neg, total)</code>, and
<code>(total, X)</code>.

    <figcaption>Figure Agents and Channels</figcaption>
</figure>



<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>

This is an example of an agent, <code>total</code>,
that receives messages from agents
<code>pos</code> and <code>neg</code>,
and sends messages to agent <code>X</code>.

See an <a href="../CODE_EXAMPLES/SumPosAndNeg.py">example
of an implementation in Python using an Agent class.</a>

The example below does not use classes so that the algorithm is easier
to understand by readers who are not familiar with Python.

<p>

The statements before the <code>receive</code> function specify the
initial values of variables.

In this example, the initial state of <code>total</code> is given by
<code>sum = 0</code>. 
</p>


<pre>
# Initialization
sum = 0

# Callback function
def receive(message, sender):
   if sender == pos:
       sum = sum + message
   else:
       sum = sum - message
       if sum < 0: sum = 0
   send(sum, X)
</pre>


If <code>total</code> receives a message from <code>pos</code> then
<code>total</code> 
 increments <code>sum</code> by the contents of the message.

If <code>total</code> receives a message from an agent other than
<code>pos</code> then <code>total</code> decrements <code>sum</code> by the
contents of the message, and if the resulting value of
<code>sum</code> is negative then <code>sum</code> is set to 0.

<p>
<code>total</code> sends the
resulting value of <code>sum</code> to agent <code>X</code>.
</p>


<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Agent</h4>
<p>
This is an example of agent <code>pos</code>.
</p>
<pre>
# Initial values of agent's variables.
my_data = [3, 5]
n = 0


# Callback function
def receive(message, sender):
   send(message=my_data[n], receiver=total)
   n = n + 1
   if n < len(my_data):
      send(message="wakeup", receiver=pos)
</pre>

<p>
<code>pos</code> has variables <code>my_data</code> and <code>n</code>
which are initially <code>[3, 5]</code> and <code>0</code>,
respectively.
</p>

<p>
When <code>pos</code> receives a message it sends
<code>my_data[n]</code> to agent <code>total</code> and then
increments <code>n</code>.
If <code>n</code> is less than the number of elements in
<code>my_data</code> then <code>pos</code> sends itself a "wakeup" message.
</p>

<p>
The system is initialized with a "wakeup" message in the channel from
<code>pos</code>  to itself.
When <code>pos</code> receives the first message it sends
<code>my_data[0]</code> to agent <code>total</code>,
increments <code>n</code> to 1
and <code>pos</code> sends another "wakeup" message to itself.
</p>

<p>
When <code>pos</code> receives the next message it sends
<code>my_data[1]</code> to agent <code>total</code>, and
increments <code>n</code> to 2, and does not send itself a message.
So, in this example, <code>pos</code> waits forever after this point
because it receives no further messages.
</p>


<p>
In this example, agent <code>neg</code> is identical to <code>pos</code> except that it
may have different values of <code>my_data</code>, 
and agent <code>X</code> has no variables. It merely prints
messages that it receives.
