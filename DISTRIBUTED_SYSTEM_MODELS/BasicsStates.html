    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">States of a Distributed System</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This page describes the state of a system and changes to a system
  state.

  The model uses a simple abstraction of state and state transitions.
  </p>

  <a name="States"></a>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">States</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  The state of a distributed system is given by the states of its agents and
  channels.

  A system state is a tuple with an element of the tuple for each
  agent and each channel.

  <p>
  The state of a channel is a queue consisting of the sequence of
  messages sent on the channel that have not been delivered.

  The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.

  <a name="StateTransitions"></a>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p>
  The state of a system changes when, and only when, a message is
  delivered to an agent.


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->  
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Execution of a <code>receive</code> is
  Atomic</h5>
  <p>
  The simple model ignores the changes in the state of an agent while
  it is executing 
  a <code>receive</code>.

  The model only consider an agent's state before
  it starts, and after it completes, executing a <code>receive</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The model treats execution of a <code>receive</code> as an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit">atomic
  operation.</a>

  A state transition occurs when one agent gets one message on one of
  its input channels and executes its <code>receive</code> function on
  that message.
  </p>

  <p>
  A <code>receive</code> function may include a <code>sleep</code>
  statement which causes the agent to execute no further statements in
the <code>receive</code> for a specified period of time.

The <code>sleep</code> statement has no effect on state
transitions because state transitions do not deal with changes in the
state of an agent while it is executing a <code>receive</code>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, <code>sleep</code> statements in <code>receive</code>
functions impact system performance.

The model does not deal with time and so the model does not deal with
performance.

We will discuss performance later.
</p>


<p>

  <a name="Events"></a>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->  
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Event: Specification of the Change in State
  during a State Transition</h5>

  The change in state that occurs when an agent <code>u</code>
  receives a message, <code>msg</code>, from an agent <code>v</code>
  is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state <code>s</code>
  before it executes the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  The sender, <code>v</code>, of the message, and the message,
  <code>msg</code>, that is received,
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>u</code>'s state <code>s'</code> after it completes execution
  of the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  A list of ordered pairs <code>(m, w)</code>, where <code>m</code> is
  the message sent to agent <code>w</code>,
  during the execution of the <code>receive</code>. 
  </li>
</ol>
The 4-tuple is called an <i>event.</i>
The first two elements of the tuple are called the <i>inputs to the event</i>, and
the last two elements are the <i>outputs of the event</i>.

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->  
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">The State Transition Caused by an Event</h5>

The event specified by the above 4-tuple
can be executed in a state <code>S</code> 
 if the inputs to the event are as specified by <code>S</code>,
i.e., in state <code>S</code>
the state of <code>u</code> is <code>s</code>, and the message at the head of the
channel <code>(v, u)</code> is <code>msg</code>.

<p>
The occurrence of the event causes a transition to a state
<code>S'</code> which is specified as follows.
The state of <code>u</code> in <code>S'</code> is
<code>s'</code>.
The change in the states of <code>u</code>'s output channels are
specified by the list in part 4 of the 4-tuple:
message <code>m</code> is appended to the tail of
the sequence of messages in channel <code>(v, w)</code>, for all
<code>(m, w)</code> in the list.

The states of all other agents and channels are the same in
<code>S</code> and <code>S'</code>.
</p>


<p>
Each execution of an agent's <code>receive</code> function is
specified by an event.

We say that an agent <code>u</code>  "executes event e",
or "event e occurs at agent <code>u</code>"
to mean that the agent executes a <code>receive</code> that is
specified by <i>e</i>.

<p>
In a state transition due to an event at agent <code>u</code>:
exactly one agent -- namely <code>u</code> -- changes state; 
exactly one message is delivered from exactly one input channel of <code>u</code>;
and messages may be appended to arbitrarily many output channels of
<code>u</code>.
The states of all other agents and channels remain unchanged by the
transition. 

<p>
If multiple agents change state concurrently then the model treats the state
changes as occurring one event at one agent at a time, in any order.


<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Events and State Transitions</h4>
An event is a 4-tuple that specifies the <i>change</i> in state during
a state transition.

An event provides no information about the agents and channels that do
not change state in the state transition.

<p>
An event is different from a state transition because a state
transition specifies the states, before and after the transition, of
<i>all</i> agents and channels, including the states of agents and
channels that remain unchanged in the transition.

<p>
For example, when an online customer deposits money into an account, the event
describing the action specifies the amount in the account before and
after the transition, the check that is deposited, and the
acknowledgment that is sent.

The event does not describe the states of all the other accounts in
the bank.








<a name="Example"></a>
<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Event</h4>

This is an example of an event at agent, <code>pos</code>.

In this example,
the state of <code>pos</code> before the event is given by the values
of its variables <code>my_data = [3, 5]</code>  and <code>n =
0</code>.

In the event, <code>pos</code> receives a "wakeup" message from
itself.

<p>
<code>pos</code>'s state after the event is <code>my_data = [3,
5]</code>  and <code>n  = 1</code>.

During the event <code>pos</code> sends a "wakeup" message to itself
and 3 to agent <code>total</code>.


The event is specified by the following tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>pos</code>'s state before it executes the <code>receive</code>
  is given by the values of its variables <code>my_data = [3,
  5]</code> and <code>n = 0</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The sender of the message that is received is <code>pos</code>, and
  the message is "wakeup".
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>pos</code>'s state after it completes execution
  of the <code>receive</code> is given by <code>my_data = [3,
  5]</code> and <code>n = 1</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The messages sent during the execution of <code>receive</code> are
  (i) "wakeup" to <code>pos</code> and  (ii) <code>3</code> to
  <code>total</code>. 
  </li>
</ol>
