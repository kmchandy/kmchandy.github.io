    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Example: Earliest Meeting Time</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h3>
Three professors (agents) indexed \(0, 1, 2\) want to find the
earliest time that all of them are free so that they can schedule an
exam for a student. Each professor \(j\) has a local variable
  \(T_{j}\) where professor \(j\) can meet at time \(T_{j}\).
  
<p>
Associated with each professor \(j\) is a function \(f_{j}\) where for
any time \(t\), \(f_{j}(t)\) is the earliest time at or after \(t\)
that professor \(j\) can meet. All professors can meet at time \(t\)
exactly when for all \(t\):
<p>
\(
f_{j}(t) = t
\)


<p>
We assume that there exists some time at which all professors can
meet. Otherwise, the student would never get to take the exam! Let the
earliest meeting time for all professors be \(\tau\).

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Channels</h3>
There is a channel from each professor to each of the other professors
as shown in the diagram. Let \(c_{j,k}\) be the channel from professor
\(j\) to professor \(k\).

    <figcaption>Fig.1: Graph Representation of the Distributed System</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Initial State</h4>
Let \(T_{j}^{0}\) be the earliest time that professor \(j\) can meet.
Initially  \(T_{j} = T_{j}^{0}\) and each of the two channels from
professor \(j\) contain a single message \(T_{j}^{0}\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions</h4>
In this example agents (i.e. professors) have no internal transitions. The
  only transitions are delivery of messages from channels.
  
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Action on Receiving a Message</h5>
Let \(t\) be the message at the head of a channel \(c\) directed
towards professor \(T_{j}^{0}\). The program executed when a message
<code>t</code> is received is:
<pre>
upon receiving t:
  if t > T[j]:
     T[j] = f(t)
     send T[j] on all outgoing channels of j
  else:
     pass
</pre>

The proof that the algorithm terminates with \(T_{j} = \tau\) for all
\(j\) is left as an exercise.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Possible Trajectory</h3>
Assume that professor \(0, 1, 2\) can only meet on days that are
postive multiples of 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Then the earliest time that all professors can meet
is 12.
Let's look at one of may possible system trajectories.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Initially</h5>
Initially the outgoing channels from professors 0, 1, 2 each contain
the message \(2, 3, 4\), respectively. Each channel has exactly one
message.



    <figure>
    <img src="EarliestMeetingTimeSlides/EarliestMeetingTimeSlides.003.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Initial State</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">A First Step</h5>
Since all the channels are nonempty, the next step can be the delivery
of a message from any channel. Assume
that message \(4\)  in channel \(c_{2, 0}\) is delivered to professor \(0\). The
state of professor \(0\) changes because \(T_{0}\) becomes 4, and
this professor send message 4 on channel \(c_{0, 2}\), and so the state of this
channel becomes the sequence \([2, 4]\) with message \(2\) ahead of message
\(4\).

    <figure>
    <img src="EarliestMeetingTimeSlides/EarliestMeetingTimeSlides.004.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: A First Step</figcaption>
  </figure>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">A Second Step</h5>
At the end of the first step, channel \(c_{2, 0}\) is
false because the channel is empty. Every other channel contains a message.
So, the next transition can be the delivery of a message from
any channel other than \(c_{2, 0}\). Suppose the next message is delivered from
channel \(c_{0, 2}\). This message is 2 because that's the message at
the head of the sequence of messages in transit along the
channel. Delivery of this message removes the message from the
channel, and the execution of this action does not change the state of
professor \(2\) because
\( (t \leq T[2]) \). The state of channel \(c_{0, 2}\) now consists of a
single message \(4\).



    <figure>
    <img src="EarliestMeetingTimeSlides/EarliestMeetingTimeSlides.005.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: A Second Step</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">A Third Step</h5>
At the end of the second step, all the channels other than \(c_{2,
0}\) are nonempty, and a
message can be delivered from any nonempty channel. Suppose the next message
delivered is the message \(4\) in channel \(c_{0, 2}\). The
delivery of this message does not change the state of professor \(2\),
and the action makes channel \(c_{0, 2}\) becomes empty.


    <figure>
    <img src="EarliestMeetingTimeSlides/EarliestMeetingTimeSlides.006.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: A Third Step</figcaption>
  </figure>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Following Steps</h5>
At the end of the third step the only nonempty channels are those to and from professor
\(1\). Think about further steps in the trajectory.
The trajectory
proceeds in this manner until all guards evaluate to false, i.e., all
channels are empty.

<p>
Verify that all trajectories end in a state in which all
channels are empty and \(T_{j} = 12\) for all \(j\).
