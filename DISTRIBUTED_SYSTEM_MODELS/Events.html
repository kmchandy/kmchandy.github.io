<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Events and Dataflow</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A change in the state of a system changes the state of at most one
  agent and the states of its incident channels.

  The local change is specified by an <i>event.</i>

  The flow of data between events at agents is represented by a
  dataflow graph.

  </p>


  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Events</h3>
  A system changes state when an agent receives a message.

  The change in state when an agent \(v\) executes
  <code>receive(msg, u)</code> is specified by an <i>event</i> which is the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  the state, \(S_{v}\), of \(v\) before it executes the <code>receive</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
  the message, <code>msg</code>, received and the channel, <code>(u,
  v)</code>, on which the message is received,
  </li>
  <li>
  the state \(S'_{v}\) of  \(v\) after it completes execution of the
  <code>receive</code>, and  
  </li>
  <li>
  for each output channel of <code>v</code>, the sequence of messages
  sent on the channel during execution of the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
There exists a transition from state \(S\) to
\(S'\) specified by an event \(e\) exactly when
the pre-transition state, \(S_{v}\),
of agent \(v\) is its state in
  \(S\), and
  the head of channel \((u, v)\) in \(S\) is <code>msg</code>.

<p>
The post-transition state \(S'\)
is uniquely determined by the pre-transition state \(S\) and the event
\(e\).

An agent can be specified by the set of events that can be executed by
the agent.

<!----------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Event</h4>
Let's look at the example in the
<a href="DistributedSystemModels.html">previous page</a>.

The example shows a state transition in which agent \(u\) receives a
wakeup message on the channel \((u, u)\), and then sends a blue
token.

After the transition \(u\) holds no tokens.



The event that cause this state transition is specified by
<ol>
  <li>
  the state of \(u\) before the transition (\(u\) holds blue token),
  </li>
  <li>
  the message <code>wakeup</code> that \(u\) receives on channel \((u,
  u)\),
  </li>
  <li>
  the state of \(u\) after the transition (\(u\) holds no tokens), and
  </li>
  <li>
  the message -- blue token -- sent by \(u\) along output channel \((u,
  v)\).
  </li>
</ol>

The figure below illustrates the event.

    <figure>
    <img
    src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.003.jpeg"
    alt="Fig1" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: Representation of an Event</figcaption>
</figure>

 <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Representation of an Event as a Vertex</h4>

The event is shown as a vertex that represents a data transformation.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Input to an Event</p>
The input to an event is the state of the agent before it executes the
<code>receive</code> and the message received.

<p>
The vertex representing the event has two input edges; one edge is
labeled with the state of 
the agent \(u\) before the event, and the other edge is labeled with the
message received and the channel on which it is received.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Output of an Event</p>
The output of an event is the state of the agent after it completes
executing <code>receive</code> and the sequences of messages sent on
the agent's output channels while it executes the <code>receive</code>.

<p>
The vertex representing the event has one output edge labeled with the
state of agent after it completes execution of the <code>receive</code>.

The vertex has an output edge for each output channel and this edge is
labeled with the sequence of messages sent along the channel in the
event.

The output edge for a channel is not shown if there are no messages
sent on the channel during the event.

<p>
In this example, only one message (blue token) is sent, and this
message is sent along channel \((u, v)\).

So, the vertex has an output edge labeled with a sequence consisting
of one message (blue token).

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow Graph of a Computation</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">
Dataflow graphs
</a>
have been
<a
href="https://www.sigops.org/2020/the-remarkable-utility-of-dataflow-computing/">
used in many domains of computer science
</a>, and they help in
understanding distributed algorithms.

<p>
Associated with a computation is a labeled, directed, acyclic graph,
called the <i>dataflow graph of the computation.</i>

An edge in a dataflow graph represents data, and a vertex represents a
transformation of data.

In our case vertices represent events of the computation.

Edges connect outputs of events to inputs of events (figure 3)


<p class="w3-text-teal">Agent Edges of a Dataflow Graph</p>
The graph has an edge from an event at an agent to the next event at
that agent.

This edge is labeled with the state of the agent between
the events and is called an <i>agent edge.</i>

<p>
We adopt the convention that agent edges are horizontal and are
directed from left to right.

The sequence of events at an agent are represented by a horizontal
line with later events to the right of earlier events.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Edges of a Dataflow Graph</p>
The graph has an edge from each event in which a message is sent to
the event in which that message is received; this edge is labeled with
the message, and is called a <i>message edge.</i>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Initial State Represented by an Event</p>
The initial state of the computation is represented by events
labeled \(0\), and the final state is represented by events
labeled \(N\).

The outputs of events numbered \(0\) are the initial states of agents
and message channels, and the inputs of events labeled \(N\) are their
final states.





<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Dataflow of a
Computation</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
Figure 2 shows a diagram of a computation from
<a href="DistributedSystemModels">the previous page</a>
and the figure 3 shows the dataflow
graph of the computation.
<figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.005.jpeg"
    alt="Fig2" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example - A Computation: a Sequence of States
</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.006.jpeg"
    alt="Fig6" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example - Dataflow Graph of a Computation</figcaption>
</figure>


The top horizontal line in figure 3 shows the timeline -- the sequence of events
-- at agent \(u\) and the lower line shows the timeline for \(v\).

<p>
The label of a horizontal edge \((e, e')\) on the timeline of an agent
\(u\) is the state of \(u\) after event \(e\) and before event \(e'\).

The purple edges show messages.

Event 1 in figure 3 is the same as the event shown in figure 1.

<p>
Let's look at the dataflow graph in detail.

Initially there is a wakeup message in the channel \((u, u)\), and the
state of agent \(u\) is "holds blue token."

So the label of the agent edge from the initial event to the first event at \(u\) 
is "holds blue token" and the label of the message edge for
channel \((u, u)\) is "wakeup."

The edges to the first event at \(v\) are similar.

<p>
Let's look at event 2.

The input agent edge is labeled "holds red token" and the input
message edge is labeled "wakeup."

The event changes \(v\)'s state to "holds no token" and that's the
label of the output agent edge from event 2.

In the event, \(v\) sends the red token to \(u\), and this is shown as
the message edge labeled with the red token.

This message edge is from event 2 to event 5, which is the event in which
\(u\) receives the message.





<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Model Preserves Dataflow</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The
<a href="DistributedSystemModels.html">previous page</a>
had the sentence:
A sequential model of a distributed system that only considers states
in which all agents are idle seems useless. Why is the model useful?

<p>
The model is useful because <i>the model preserves the dataflow of the system.</i>


<p>
What is the most information any agent can get about the evolution of
the system state?

An agent \(A\) can ask all agents to record and send their timelines
to \(A\).

Time is irrelevant, however, because clocks may drift by
arbitrary amounts.

The only information that an agent can obtain is the
dataflow graph.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Timelines and Computations</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.012.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Example - Timeline and Computation with the
same Dataflow Graph
</figcaption>
</figure>
The top diagram of figure 4 shows the timeline of a trajectory of a
system with agents \(u, v\).

The horizontal axis represents time, and the length of an event
represents the time taken to execute the event.

A message is directed from a point representing the time at which the
message is sent to a point representing the time at which the message
is received.

<p>
Let's look at execution of the receive by agent \(u\) represented by
event 1 in the top diagram.

As execution proceeds, \(u\)'s variables change, and at some
point \(u\) sends message \(m_{2}\) and at a later point it sends
\(m_{3}\).

<p>
Events 2 and 3 start after event 1 starts, and finish before event 1
finishes.

Our simple model cannot capture this situation.

<p>
The lower diagram shows a computation in our model. 

The lower diagram can be obtained from the upper diagram by making the
durations of events infinitisimally small.

In the lower diagram events 2 and 3 are executed after event 1 finishes.

<p>
Though the model does not capture elapsed time, the  model faithfully
represents dataflow at the granularity of events. 

The dataflow graphs in both diagrams is the same.





<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations</h3>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Fairness and Progress</p>
In the model, a computation progresses by delivering a message on <i>any</i>
channel.

The model allows messages on some channels to be never delivered.

Later, we will extend the model to include fair selection.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">No construct for Time</p>
The only representation of time in our model is that some events occur
before others.

Processes can maintain accurate clocks by using atomic clocks, Precision Time
Protocols (PTP) in local area networks, and Network Time Protocol
(NTP) servers.

Later, we discuss the use of time in distributed algorithms.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Failure, Start Up, Shutdown</p>
The model does not deal with failure of agents or channels, nor does
it deal with starting and stopping systems.

Distributed computing platforms, such as AMQP, have operations to deal
with failure.

Failure modes are discussed later.



<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Local Clocks and Timing</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------->

Agents may have local clocks; however, clocks aren't synchronized.

Times at local clocks may deviate
from each other and the true time by arbitrary amounts.

<p>
We use local clocks in some algorithms.

For instance an agent may send
a heartbeat message periodically indicating that it hasn't stopped
executing.

The performance of some algorithms depends on intervals of time
determined by local clocks.

We will, however, prove the correctness of all
algorithms without using local clocks.


<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<p style="color:red;">Time</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
Clocks of agents are not synchronized.

When we prove properties of the algorithm, we make no assumptions
about how long an agent sleeps when it executes 
<code>time.sleep(1)</code>.

Time and clocks play critical role in analyzing the performance of
distributed algorithms, but not in analyzing their correctness.

Later, we will study algorithms in which local clocks of agents are
synchronized. 


<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<p style="color:red;">Discrete State Space</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
The state space is discrete in most of the algorithms described here.

Later, we study some algorithms in which the state space is
continuous.

<p>
The algorithm for an agent is a set of statements that define the
initial value of the agent and a definition of the agent's
<code>receive</code> function.



<p>
The set of states of an agent is the set of possible values of the agent's
variables including its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter">
program counters
</a>.

In the algorithms described in this course an agent is a
sequential program; however,

an agent may be any object that sends and
receives messages, and an agent may itself be a  distributed programs.
