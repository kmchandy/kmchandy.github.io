<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Events and Dataflow</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A change in the state of a system changes the state of at most one
  agent and the states of its incident channels.

  The local change is specified by an <i>event.</i>

  The flow of data between events at agents is represented by a
  dataflow graph.

  </p>


  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Events</h3>
  A system changes state when an agent receives a message.

  The change in state when an agent \(v\) executes
  <code>receive(msg, u)</code> is specified by an <i>event</i> which is the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  the state, \(S_{v}\), of \(v\) before it executes the <code>receive</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
  the message, <code>msg</code>, received and the channel, <code>(u,
  v)</code>, on which the message is received,
  </li>
  <li>
  the state \(S'_{v}\) of  \(v\) after it completes execution of the
  <code>receive</code>, and  
  </li>
  <li>
  for each output channel of <code>v</code>, the sequence of messages
  sent on the channel during execution of the <code>receive</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
There exists a transition from state \(S\) to \(S'\) specified by
event \(e\), defined above, exactly when
(1) the pre-transition state, \(S_{v}\), of agent \(v\), is its state in
\(S\), and
(2)
  the head of channel \((u, v)\) in \(S\) is <code>msg</code>.

<p>
The post-transition state \(S'\)
is uniquely determined by the pre-transition state \(S\) and the event
\(e\).

An agent can be specified by the set of events that can be executed by
the agent.

<!----------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of an Event</h4>
Let's look at the example in the
<a href="DistributedSystemModels.html">previous page</a>.

The example shows a state transition in which agent \(u\) receives a
wakeup message on the channel \((u, u)\), and then sends a blue
token.

After the transition \(u\) holds no tokens.



The event that cause this state transition is specified by
<ol>
  <li>
  the state of \(u\) before the transition (\(u\) holds blue token),
  </li>
  <li>
  the message <code>wakeup</code> that \(u\) receives on channel \((u,
  u)\),
  </li>
  <li>
  the state of \(u\) after the transition (\(u\) holds no tokens), and
  </li>
  <li>
  the message -- blue token -- sent by \(u\) along output channel \((u,
  v)\).
  </li>
</ol>

The figure below illustrates the event.

    <figure>
    <img

    alt="Fig1" style="width:80%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example: Representation of an Event</figcaption>
</figure>

 <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Representation of an Event as a Vertex</h4>

The event is shown as a vertex that represents a data transformation.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Inputs to an Event</p>
An event has two inputs: (1) the identity \(v\) of the agent that
changes state in the event, and the state of \(v\) before the event,
and (2) the message received in the event and the sender of the message.

The vertex representing the event has two input edges corresponding to
each of the two inputs.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Output of an Event</p>
The output of an event is the state of the agent after it completes
executing <code>receive</code> and the sequences of messages sent on
the agent's output channels while it executes the <code>receive</code>.

<p>
The vertex representing the event has one output edge labeled with the
state of agent after it completes execution of the <code>receive</code>.

The vertex has an output edge for each output channel and this edge is
labeled with the sequence of messages sent along the channel in the
event.

The output edge for a channel is not shown if there are no messages
sent on the channel during the event.

<p>
In figure 1, only one message (blue token) is sent, and this
message is sent along channel \((u, v)\).

So, the vertex has an output edge labeled with a sequence consisting
of one message (blue token).

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Dataflow Graph of a Computation</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">
Dataflow graphs
</a>
have been
<a
href="https://www.sigops.org/2020/the-remarkable-utility-of-dataflow-computing/">
used in many domains of computer science
</a>, and they help in
understanding distributed algorithms.

<p>
Associated with a computation is a labeled, directed, acyclic graph,
called the <i>dataflow graph of the computation.</i>

An edge in a dataflow graph represents data, and a vertex represents a
transformation of data.

In our case vertices represent events of the computation.

Edges connect outputs of events to inputs of events (figure 3)


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Agent Edges of a Dataflow Graph</h5>
The dataflow graph of a computation has an edge from an event at an
agent in the computation to the next event at that agent.

This edge is labeled with the state of the agent between
the events and is called an <i>agent edge.</i>

<p>
We adopt the convention that agent edges are horizontal and are
directed from left to right.

The sequence of events at an agent are represented by a horizontal
line with later events to the right of earlier events.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Message Edges of a Dataflow Graph</h5>
The graph has an edge from each event in which a message is sent to
the event in which that message is received; this edge is labeled with
the message, and is called a <i>message edge.</i>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Initial and Final States Represented by Events</h5>
The initial state of the computation is represented by events
labeled \(0\), and the final state is represented by events
labeled \(N\).

The outputs of events numbered \(0\) are the initial states of agents
and message channels, and the inputs of events labeled \(N\) are their
final states.





<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Dataflow of a
Computation</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
Figure 2 shows a diagram of a computation \([S_{0}, \ldots, S_{8}]\) from
<a href="DistributedSystemModels">the previous page</a>
and the figure 3 shows the dataflow
graph of the computation.
<figure>

    alt="Fig2" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example - A Computation: a Sequence of States
\([S_{0}, \ldots, S_{8}]\)
</figcaption>
</figure>

    alt="Fig6" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Example - Dataflow Graph of the Computation of
    figure 2</figcaption>
</figure>


The top horizontal line in figure 3 shows the timeline -- the sequence of events
-- at agent \(u\) and the lower line shows the timeline for \(v\).

<p>
The label of a horizontal edge \((e, e')\) on the timeline of an agent
\(u\) is the state of \(u\) after event \(e\) and before event \(e'\).

The purple edges represent messages.

Event 1 in figure 3 is the same as the event shown in figure 1.

<p>
Let's look at the dataflow graph in detail, and let's begin by looking
at event 2 in figure 3. Event 2 is the first event at agent \(v\).

<p>
Initially there is a wakeup message in the channel \((v, v)\), and the
initial state of agent \(v\) is "holds red token."

So the label of the agent \(v\) edge from the initial event to event 2 
is "holds red token" and the label of the message edge for
channel \((v, v)\) from the initial event to event 2 is "wakeup."


<p>
The event changes \(v\)'s state to "holds no token." So the
label of the output agent edge from event 2 is "holds no token."

The agent edge from event 2 is to event 3 which is the next event at agent \(v\) in the
computation.

By convention, this edge is drawn as a horizontal line with event 3 to
the right of event 2.

<p>
In event 2, \(v\) sends the red token to \(u\), and this is shown as
the message edge labeled with the red token.

This message edge is from event 2 to event 5, which is the event in which
\(u\) receives the message.





<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Model Preserves Dataflow</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The
<a href="DistributedSystemModels.html">previous page</a>
had the sentence:
A sequential model of a distributed system that only considers states
in which all agents are idle seems useless. Why is the model useful?

The model is useful because:
<p>
<center>
<i>The model preserves the dataflow of the system.</i>
</center>
</p>

Let's look at an example of the evolution of the state of a system in
true time and compare dataflow in this true evolution with the
dataflow in a computation in the model.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow in True Timelines and Model Computations</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->

The top diagram of figure 4 shows the true timeline showing the
evolution of the state of a system with agents \(u, v\).

The lower diagram shows the dataflow graph of a computation in the
model.


<figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.013.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Example - Timeline and Computation with the
same Dataflow Graph
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the top diagram,
the horizontal axis represents true time, and the length of an event
represents the time taken to execute the event.

A message is directed from a point representing the time at which the
message is sent to a point representing the time at which the message
is received.

<p>
Define the dataflow graph of a true system evolution -- top diagram --
in a way that is similar to dataflow graphs of computations.

Message edges are labeled with the content of the messages.

A message edge is directed from the event in which the message is sent
to the event in which the message is received.

The label of the agent edge after an agent completes execution of a
<code>receive</code> is its state at that point.

<p>
Let's compare the dataflow graphs for true evolution of system states
(top diagram)
versus that of computations in the model (lower diagram).

<p>
Let's first look at event 1 in the top diagram in detail.

Event 1 represents execution of a <code>receive</code> by agent
\(u\). 

Event 1 starts when \(u\) receives the message sent in event 0.

As execution proceeds, \(u\)'s variables change, and at some
point \(u\) sends message \(m_{2}\) and at a later point it sends
\(m_{3}\).

<p>
Events 2 and 3 represent executions of <code>receive</code> by agent
\(v\).

Event 2 starts when \(v\) receives message \(m_{2}\) from \(u\).

Events 2 finishes before event 1 finishes.

Similarly, event 3 starts when \(v\) receives message \(m_{3}\) from
\(u\) and finishes before event 1 finishes.

Events 2 and 3 start after event 1 and finish before event 1.

<p>
<i>
The model does not capture this situation.
</i>

<p>
The lower diagram shows a computation in our model. 

The lower diagram can be obtained from the upper diagram by making the
durations of events infinitisimally small.

In the lower diagram events 2 and 3 are executed after event 1
finishes, whereas in the top diagram they finish before event 1 does.

<p>
The model does not capture the evolution of the system state over
time; however, computations in the model faithfully 
represents dataflow at the granularity of events. 

The dataflow graphs in both diagrams are identical.

This is because a computation is obtained from a true evolution by
shrinking the time to execute an event to an infinitisimally small
value. So, the states of agents
after they complete events and the messages sent are the same in both
cases. 



<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">What Information do Timelines Provide?</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
What information can any agent get about the evolution of
the system state?

An agent \(X\) can ask all agents to record and send their timelines
to \(X\).

An agent timeline is a horizontal line in the dataflow graph.

What can be deduced from the agent timelines that \(X\) receives?

<p>
A timeline of an agent is the sequence of events at the agent.

We know that a message is received after it is sent.

So, we can create a (unique) dataflow graph from the set of agent
timelines of all agents.

The timeline may also have the duration between events as determined
by the agent's clock; however, this information isn't useful because
clocks can drift apart by arbitrary amounts.

<p>
<i>
The only information that can be deduced from a set of agent timelines
in a computation 
is the dataflow graph of the computation.
</i>

<p>
When we design algorithms dataflow graphs provide all the
information that we use about state evolution.
