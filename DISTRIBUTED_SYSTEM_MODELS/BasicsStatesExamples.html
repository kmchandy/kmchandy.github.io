    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">States: Examples</h1>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

   <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Simple Example</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

Two children, X and Y, are tossing balloons to each other.

A balloon that has been tossed by X, while in the air to Y, is a
message in the channel (X, Y\).

When a child gets a balloon it tosses the balloon back immediately.

Initially there is a balloon tossed by X on its way to Y and there is
also a balloon tossed by Y on its way to X.

<p>
  Each child has a countdown of the number of times it tosses balloons.

  Each time a child tosses a balloon it decrements its countdown value.

After a child's countdown reaches 0 the child pops balloons that it receives
(and doesn't toss popped balloons). 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State</h4>
The state of a channel is the number of balloons in it.

The state of an agent (X or Y) is the countdown value nX or nY, respectively.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Sequence of State Changes</h4>
An example of a sequence of state changes is as follows.
<ol>
  <li>
  Initial State: Channel (X, Y) has one balloon and channel (Y, X) has
  one balloon. And the countdown for X is 2 and the countdown for Y is
  3. We represent this state by:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes:
  <br>
  nX = 1, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and  sends it back. So the state
  becomes
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and sends it back. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  X receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  Y receives a balloon and pops it. So the state
  becomes 
  <br>
  nX = 0, nY = 0, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 0
  </li>
  <li>There are no further steps in this computation
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Events</h5>
The state transition caused by the first event is specified by the
following 4-tuple

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Event: Y receives a balloon for the first time</h5>
This event is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  Y's state before the event is nY = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  The message that is received is 1 (balloon) and the message is from
  X. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Y's state after the event is nY = 1
  <li>
  The message that is sent in the event is 1 (balloon) and the message is to
  X. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">State Transition Caused by the Event</h5>
The execution of this event at Y causes a state transition from 
<br>
nX = 1, nY = 2, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1
<br>
to
<br>
nX = 1, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">In what States can the Event be Executed?</h5>
This event can be executed in any state S in which the inputs to the
event are specified by the state, i.e., in S:
<ol>
  <li>
  Y's state in S is nY = 2
  </li>
  <li>
  The channel (X, Y) has a message 1 at its head. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Details of the State Transition Caused by the
Event</h5>
This event causes a transition from S to a state S' where
<ol>
  <li>
  Y's state in S' is nY = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message at the head of channel (X, Y) in state S is removed from the channel
  </li>
  <li>
  A message "1" is appended to the tail of channel (Y, X) in state S.
</ol>


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Event: X receives a balloon for the first time</h5>
This event is specified by the 4-tuple:
<ol>
  <li>
  X's state before the event is nX = 1
  </li>
  <li>
  The message that is received is 1 (balloon) and the message is from
  Y. 
  </li>
  <li>
  X's state after the event is nX = 0
  <li>
  The message that is sent in the event is 1 (balloon) and the message is to
  Y. 
  </li>
</ol>

The execution of this event at X causes a state transition from 
<br>
nX = 1, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 0, (Y, X) = 2
<br>
to
<br>
nX = 0, nY = 1, (X, Y) = 1, (Y, X) = 1

  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Invariants</h2>

  We reason about the correctness of many distributed algorithms in
  in the same way that we reason about sequential
  <code>while</code> loops, by using invariants and loop variants.




  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Loop Invariant of a Sequential While Loop</h3>
  
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">
  loop invariant</a>
  is an assertion about the state of the program that holds before and
  after each iteration of the loop.

  You can look up

  <a
  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2112/2020fa/lectures/lecture.html?id=loopinv">
  many examples</a> of loop invariants on the web.


  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
  
  A loop invariant in the following greatest common
  divisor (gcd) program is shown in the body of the loop as the
  assertion <code>gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)</code>.
  
    <pre>
x, y = X, Y
while x != y:
  # assertion: gcd(x, y) = gcd(X, Y)
  if x > y: x = x - y
  else: y = y - x
  </pre>

  
  <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Invariant of a Distributed System</h3>
  
  An invariant of a distributed system is a
  predicates that holds in all states reachable from initial states.

  An invariant of a distributed system is the loop invariant of the
  following while loop.

  An invariant <code>Inv</code> is shown
  as an assertion in the body of the loop.
  
  <pre>
while there exists a nonempty input channel in the system:
   # assertion: Inv
   select a nonempty channel (u, v) in the system
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   v executes receive(msg, u)
  </pre>

  The remainder of this webpage consists of examples of invariants.

<h2 style="color:red;">Examples</h2>
</center>
  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
  
  We are given a strongly connected network of agents -- i.e.,
  there is a path from each agent to every other agent.

  Each agent has a local variable <code>n</code>, which is initialized
  as a positive integer.
  
  Let GCD be the gcd (greatest commond divisor) of the
  initial values of <code>X.n</code> of all agents <code>X.n</code>.

  The following distributed algorithm terminates and at termination
  <code>X.n = GCD</code> for all agents <code>X.n</code>.

In the code, <code>successors</code> is the list of successor agents
in a network of agents.

<pre>
def receive(message, sender):
   if n != gcd(n, message):
      n = gcd(n, message)
      for successor in successors:
         send(n, successor)
</pre>

An invariant of the distributed algorithm is as follows.
The gcd of all messages in channels and 
<code>X.n</code> for all agents <code>X</code>
is equal to GCD.

  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <p style="color:red;">Proof</p>
  
The proof that the assertion holds initially is trivial.

Prove that if the assertion holds before any event 
then it continues to hold after the event.

<p>
Let the event be agent <code>A</code> receiving a message
<code>m</code>.
After the event, <code>m</code> is no longer in the channel;
<code>n = gcd(n, m)</code>; and messages with the new value of
<code>n</code> are in the output channels from <code>A</code>.
The proof that the assertion continues to hold in the post-event state
is straightforward.


  <!----------------------------------------------->
<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>

Another invariant for the gcd example, given earlier, is as follows.
For all channels <code>(X, Y)</code> in the network:
<ol>
  <li>
  Channel <code>(X, Y)</code> is empty and <code>X.n</code> is a
  multiple of <code>Y.n</code>, or
  </li>
  <li>
  The last message in channel <code>(X, Y)</code> is <code>m</code>
  where <code>m = X.n</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <p style="color:red;">Proof</p>
  
The assertion holds initially because the second condition holds. 

Prove that if the assertion holds before any event
then it continues to hold after the event.

<p>
When agent <code>X</code> executes a receive that changes
<code>X.n</code> the agent sends a message <code>m</code> to
<code>Y</code> where <code>m = X.n</code>, and so the second condition
holds.

<p>
When agent <code>Y</code> receives <code>m</code> the agent sets
<code>Y.n = gcd(Y.n, m)</code>, and so <code>m</code> is a multiple of
the new value of <code>Y.n</code>.

If channel <code>(X, Y)</code> remains nonempty then the second
condition holds.

If <code>(X, Y)</code> becomes empty then the first condition holds
because <code>m = X.n</code> and <code>m</code> is a multiple of
<code>Y.n</code>.
