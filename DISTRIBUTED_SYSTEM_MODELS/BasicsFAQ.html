    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Basics: FAQ</h1>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->


   
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What is a model?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  A model of a system is an
  <a href="Basics.html#WhatIsAModel">abstraction that ignores aspects of the
  system</a> but which helps in developing algorithms.


     
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What model does this course use?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  The choice of a model is an engineering decision, and we use
  different models to solve different problems.

  We begin <a href="Basics.html#ASimpleModel">with a simple actor
  model.</a> 

  
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What are weaknesses and limitations of the model?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model has many weaknesses, only some of which are described
  here.

  
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Fairness and
  Progress</h6>
  In the model, a computation progresses by delivering a message on
<i>any</i> channel.

  This allows for infinite computations in which some messages remain
  in a channel forever.

  <p>
  Consider an example of two agents sending
  tokens to each other.

  Each agent sends a token that it holds to the other agent.

  So there is a computation in which tokens go back and forth between
  the agents forever. 

  Let's call this distributed system <code>D</code>.

  <p>
  Now, consider a system consisting of two identical, and totally
  independent, copies of <code>D</code>.

  There is no connection between the two copies.

  Surely, the behavior of <code>D</code> shouldn't change because of
  the presence of a completely independent network of agents.

  But, with our model, it does.

  <p>
  A computation progresses by delivering a message from <i>any</i>
  nonempty channel.

  So, there is an infinite computation in which messages are delivered
  in channels in one copy of <code>D</code>, and no messages are
  delivered from nonempty channels in the other copy


  <p>
  The problem is that the selection of the nonempty channel in each
  iteration of the while loop may be unfair -- the same set of
  channels could be selected forever while other nonempty channels are
  never selected.

  The model has no provision for ensuring that a message in a channel
  will be delivered eventually.

  We will introduce fair selection,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITY_(programming_language)">eventuality</a>, and
  <a href="<code>D</code">temporal logic</a> later in the course.



<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: No Construct for Time</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

The only representation of time in our model is that some events occur
after others.

An event in which a message is received occurs after an event in which
that message is sent.

Time plays a critical role in the performance of algorithms even
though we never use time in proving the correctness of algorithms.

<p>
There are many algorithms in which an agent sends itself a <code>Timeout(T)</code>
message where ideally the message would be received approximately <code>T</code>
seconds after it is sent.


Though we never use <code>T</code> in proving the correctness of algorithms we will use
timeout messages in analyzing their performance.


<p>
Agents can maintain accurate clocks by using atomic clocks, Precision Time
Protocols (PTP) in local area networks, and Network Time Protocol
(NTP) servers.

Accurate clocks have the property that the time at which an event is
sent, as determined by the sender's clock, is (almost always) earlier
than the time of the event in which the message is received.

We do not, however, rule out the possibility that clocks drift apart
so that the sender's clock is far ahead of the receiver's.

<p>
Some algorithms for systems with perfect clocks are simpler than those
with imperfect clocks, as we shall see.


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Start Up, Shutdown, Failure</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

The model assumes that all agents and channels are initialized and
then agents start receiving messages.

The model has a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)">
barrier </a>
between the point at which initialization takes place and the point at
which messages are delivered.

The barrier isn't necessary in most algorithms, though it assuming its
existence helps us to focus on more important parts of the algorithm.

<p>
The model does not specify how termination is detected if the
computation does terminate.

Nor does the notation have primitives for shutting down agents and
channels gracefully so that they don't continue to hold resources
after computation has terminated.

Protocols such as AMQP do have primitives for starting up and shutting
down distributed systems, but we won't discuss them here.

<p>
We will describe algorithms that execute on faulty systems in which
messages may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order, and where
agents may stop forever or halt and restart.

We also describe algorithms with Byzantine agents.

These algorithms are based on models that are different from those
given so far.



<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Discrete State Space</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
The state space is discrete in most of the algorithms described here.

The state space of some distributed systems has both discrete and
continuous components.

The state space of a fleet of drones has continuous components.

<p>
Later, we study algorithms in which the state space is
continuous.

Systems with continuous state spaces may have discrete or continuous
state transitions.



<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Static</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  The network of agents and messages in the model is static.

  In contrast, distributed systems evolve; agents and channels may be
  added and deleted; agents may change; channel protocols may be
modified.





<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Simple Channels</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model only considers channels in which messages are delivered in
  the order sent.

  Some distributed systems have channels in which messages may be
duplicated and delivered out of order.

<p>
Many models deal with channels in which senders are blocked when a
channel gets full.

Our model has no concept of a channel being full.



<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Model Limitations: Summary</h6>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
Models and notations in this course are not comprehensive -- they do not capture
most aspects of distributed systems.
We use a model that is appropriate for describing the algorithm at
hand.
The choice of a model is an engineering decision.



  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Why use such a simplistic model?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model is indeed simplistic; however, it is adequate for describing
  and reasoning about many of the algorithms described in the first
  part of this course.

  We introduce other models later.

  We use the simplest model adequate for the problem at hand.


  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">How many channels are there in a system?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
The number of channels in the model is arbitrary.

In the model, there can be a channel from any agent to any agent.

  So, if there are \(N\) agents there can be a maximum of \(N^{2}\) channels.

<p>
Other models allow for multiple channels from an agent \(X\) to an
agent \(Y\).

In our model, however, there can be at most one channel from \(X\) to \(Y\).
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can you describe channels in more detail?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Our <a href="Basics.html#Channels">basic description of channels is
  found here.</a> 

  Channels in our model are asynchronous (non-blocking) and
  unidirectional.

  A sender can send messages on a channel regardless of how many
  messages have been sent in the past and how many messages have been
  received on that channel.

  The model assumes that the queue of messages in the channel has
  infinite capacity.

  <p>
A channel is unidirectional.

It is represented by a directed edge in a directed graph.

Messages can be sent by an agent <code>P</code> to an agent
<code>Q</code> along a channel <code>(P, Q)</code>.

Agent <code>Q</code> cannot send a message to agent <code>P</code>
along channel <code>(P, Q)</code>.

<p>
A system may have a channel <code>(P, Q)</code> and may or may not have a channel
<code>(Q, P)</code>.

Some systems have bidirectional channels in which messages can be sent
in both directions on the same channel.

Our model does not allow for bidirectional channels.

<p>
In our model, 
a channel is directed from exactly one agent to exactly one agent.

In some systems, multiple agents can send messages on the same
channel, and multiple agents can receive messages on the same channel.

Our model does not allow for such channels.

    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">In the model, aree messages on a channel
  received in the 
  order in which they are sent on the channel?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Yes.

<p>
Because queues are FIFO (first-in-first-out),
for all \(n\), the \(n\)-th message received on a channel is the
\(n\)-th message sent on that channel.

<p>
Note that messages sent on <i>different</i> channels may not be
delivered in the order sent.

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">How can you show that in the model a
  message is received only after it is sent?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
A message can be removed from a queue only after the message is put in
the queue.

So, in the model, a message can be received only after it is sent.


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent refuse to receive a message?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  In this model an agent cannot refuse to receive a message.

  If a channel is not empty then a message from the channel can be
  delivered to the agent <i>independent of the state of the agent</i>.
  

<p>
 Suppose you want to design an algorithm in which an agent
  <code>X</code> refuses to receive messages from an agent
  <code>Z</code> until it first receives a message from an agent
  <code>Y</code>.

  How would you use this model?

  <p>

In our model, agent <code>X</code> has to receive the message from
  <code>Z</code> in every state of <code>X</code>.

  <p>
  Agent <code>X</code> can copy the message from <code>Z</code> into a
  local queue -- a local variable of <code>X</code> -- and process the
  message only after receiving the message from <code>Y</code>.
  

  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can a full channel block a sender from
  sending more messages?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
In the model a sender is never blocked from sending a message.

<p>
Our model assumes that channels have unlimited capacity.

We can represent a situation in which channels have limited capacity
in the following way.

An agent has a local output queue of unlimited size.

The agent puts messages into this queue when it cannot send messages
on a channel because the channel is full.

Messages from this queue are sent on the channel when the
channel stops being full.




    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can you represent systems in which agents
  are created and deleted in the model?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model doesn't have features that allow agents to be created and
  deleted.


<p>
A work around for the case in which agents are created or deleted a
finite number of times is as follows.

The network of agents in the model is made large enough to include
agents that have not been created as yet and also include agents that
have been deleted.

<p>
An agent that has not been created is represented by an agent that is
idle, i.e., one is waiting for a message. It never receives a message
until the agent is created. The message is created by the operating
system sending a "create" message to the agent and informing other
agents that this agent has been created.

<p>
An agent this is deleted is represented in the same way.

The operating system deletes an agent by sending a "delete" message to
the agent.

A deleted agent discards messages that it receives without
taking action.

  


    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent process background jobs that
  are interrupted when messages arrive?</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

No, there are no interruptions in the model.

When an agent is executing a receive it is not interrupted.

<p>
There are systems in which messages have different priorities, and the
arrival of high-priority messages interrupts the execution of
low-priority messages.

Our model does not allow for interruptions.


  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">How do you represent channels that are not
  first in first out?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
We use queues to represent states of first in first out channels, and
  we use other data structures -- such as multisets -- to represent
  states of other types of channels. 

<p>
Later we describe algorithms with different types of channels.

  For example, the state of a channel in which messages may overtake
  each other is a multiset or bag.

  A message is sent on a channel by adding the message to the
  multiset.

  A nonempty multiset may deliver any message in the mutliset to the
  receiving agent.

  <p>
  Lossy channels, and channels in which messages have priorities, are
  also modeled by defining channel states appropriately.

        
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent sequential
  composition of distributed computations?</h5>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Yes.

<p>
There are problems in which we would like to start a distributed
computation <code>P</code>; wait for <code>P</code> to finish, and
then start another distributed computation <code>Q</code>.

We want a barrier between <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.

<p>
A barrier can be implemented in several ways.

An agent, say a <i>coordinator</i> agent, sends messages to all agents to start
<code>P</code>.

The coordinator then detects termination of <code>P</code>; we discuss
termination detection algorithms later.

After detecting termination of <code>P</code> the coordinator sends
messages to all agents to start <code>Q</code>.
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent agents that make state transitions
  without receiving messages? </h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
No, the model does not represent agents that make state transitions
without receiving messages.

The effect of a state transition without receiving a message can be
simulated by an agent sending itself a message and carrying out the
transition when it receives a message from itself.

<p>

For example, an agent that is computing using a set of files may
  transition to a state in which it no longer needs those files; this
transition occurs without the agent receiving a message.

We model this event by having the agent send itself a message when it
starts using the set of files, and it transits to a state in which it
no longer needs the files when it receives the message from itself.

  <p>
  Representing internal state changes in this way is an artifice;
  however, the artifice allows us to use a very simple model in which a
  state change occurs when, and only when, a message is delivered.



  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What is an agent? </h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
In our model,
<a href=Basics.html#Agents">an agent is an object that sends and
receives messages.</a>

Some papers refer to an agent as an <i>actor</i> or as a
<i>process</i>. 


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What is a simple example of the notation? </h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
See <a href="Basics.html#Example">an example of the notation</a>.

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Local clocks can be synchronized using NTP
  and other protocols. Why do you assume that clocks aren't synchronized? </h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Local clocks can, indeed, be synchronized very accurately; however, we
  do not assume that they are perfect.

<p>
We use agents' local clocks for evaluating algorithm performance but
not for proving correctness because even a small drift can cause race
conditions. 

<p>
Consider an algorithm in which one agent carries out a computation
starting at 1pm and another agent carries out a computation starting at 2pm.

When we prove the correctness of our algorithms, we allow for the
unlikely possibility that that the agent starting its 
computation at 2pm does so before the agent that starts a 1pm.

For evaluating performance, however, we assume that the agent that starts a 1pm
usually does so before the agent that starts at 2pm.



  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">What are other examples of models? </h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
The model we use is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model.</a>
