    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Basics: FAQ</h1>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Why use such a simplistic model?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model is indeed simplistic; however, it is adequate for describing
  and reasoning about many of the algorithms described in the first
  part of this course.

  We introduce other models later.

  We use the simplest model adequate for the problem at hand.

  <p>
  We point out the model's weaknesses and we introduce other models as
  needed to deal with different problems.


  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent refuse to receive a message?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  In this model an agent cannot refuse to receive a message.

  If a channel is not empty then a message from the channel can be
  delivered to the agent <i>independent of the state of the agent</i>.
  

<p>
 Suppose you want to design an algorithm in which an agent
  <code>X</code> refuses to receive messages from an agent
  <code>Z</code> until it first receives a message from an agent
  <code>Y</code>.

  How would you use this model?

  <p>

In our model, agent <code>X</code> has to receive the message from
  <code>Z</code> in every state of <code>X</code>.

  <p>
  Agent <code>X</code> can copy the message from <code>Z</code> into a
  local queue -- a local variable of <code>X</code> -- and process the
  message only after receiving the message from <code>Y</code>.
  

  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can a full channel block a sender from
  sending more messages?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
In the model a sender is never blocked from sending a message.

<p>
How could this model be used to analyze a system in which a channel
has a maximum size, and
when a channel is full it cannot accept messages?

<p>
Our model assumes that channels have unlimited capacity.

We can represent a situation in which channels have limited capacity
in the following way.

An agent has a local output queue into which the agent puts messages
when the channel is full.

Messages from this output queue are sent on the channel when the
channel stops being full.




    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can you represent systems in which agents
  are created and deleted in the model?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model doesn't have features that allow agents to be created and
  deleted.

<p>
  You may want to implement a system in which agents are created and
  deleted infinitely often. 

  In this case the network of agents changes over time in an arbitrary
  fashion. 

  The model doesn't represent such systems.

<p>
A work around for the case in which agents are created or deleted a
finite number of times is as follows.

The network of agents in the model is made large enough to include
agents that have not been created as yet and also include agents that
have been deleted.

An agent that has not been created is represented by an agent that is
idle, i.e., one that doesn't receive messages.

An agent this is deleted is represented in the same way.
  


    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent process background jobs that
  are interrupted when messages arrive?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

No, there are no interruptions in the model.

After an agent is initiated it does nothing but execute receives or wait to execute
receives.

When an agent is executing a receive it is not interrupted by the
arrival of another message.


  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">How do you represent channels that are not
  first in first out?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
We use queues to represent states of first in first out channels, and
  we use other data structures -- such as multisets -- to represent
  states of other types of channels. 

<p>
Later we describe algorithms with different types of channels.

  For example, the state of a channel in which messages may overtake
  each other is a multiset or bag.

  A message is sent on a channel by adding the message to the
  multiset.

  A nonempty multiset may deliver any message in the mutliset to the
  receiving agent.

  <p>
  Lossy channels, and channels in which messages have priorities, are
  also modeled by defining channel states appropriately.

        
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent sequential
  composition of distributed computations?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Yes.

<p>
There are problems in which we would like to start a distributed
computation <code>P</code>; wait for <code>P</code> to finish, and
then start another distributed computation <code>Q</code>.

We want a barrier between <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.

<p>
A barrier can be implemented in several ways.

An agent, say a <i>coordinator</i> agent, sends messages to all agents to start
<code>P</code>.

The coordinator then detects termination of <code>P</code>; we discuss
termination detection algorithms later.

After detecting termination of <code>P</code> the coordinator sends
messages to all agents to start <code>Q</code>.
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent agents that make state transitions
  without receiving messages? </p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
No, the model does not represent agents that make state transitions
without receiving messages.

The effect of a state transition without receiving a message can be
simulated by an agent sending itself a message and carrying out the
transition when it receives a message from itself.

<p>
Some books on distributed systems allow agents to make <i>internal</i>
  state transitions -- these are transitions without receiving
messages.

For example, an agent that is computing using a set of files may
  transition to a state in which it no longer needs those files; this
transition occurs without the agent receiving a message.

Can the model represent such internal state transitions?

<p>
Internal state transitions are represented by transitions in which an
agent receives a message from itself.

  We represent an internal state change by having the agent
  send a message to itself; the agent makes a state change when it
receives the message.

<p>
For example, an agent that is computing using a set of files sends a
message "<i>finished using files</i>" to itself, and when the message
arrives, the agent changes state to one in which it no longer using
the files.

  <p>
  Representing internal state changes in this way is an artifice;
  however, the artifice allows us to use a simple model in which a
  state change occurs only when a message is delivered.


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Local clocks can be synchronized using NTP
  and other protocols. Why do you assume that clocks aren't synchronized? </p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Local clocks can, indeed, be synchronized very accurately; however, we
  do not assume that they are perfect.

<p>
We use agents' local clocks for evaluating algorithm performance but
not for proving correctness because even a small drift can cause race
conditions. 

<p>
Consider an algorithm in which one agent carries out a computation
starting at 1pm and another agent carries out a computation starting at 2pm.

When we prove the correctness of our algorithms, we allow for the
unlikely possibility that that the agent starting its 
computation at 2pm does so before the agent that starts a 1pm.

For evaluating performance, however, we assume that the agent that starts a 1pm
usually does so before the agent that starts at 2pm.
