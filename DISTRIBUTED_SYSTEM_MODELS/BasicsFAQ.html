    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Basics: FAQ</h1>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Why use such a simplistic model?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model is indeed simplistic; however, it is adequate to describe
  and prove the correctness of the algorithms described in this
  website.

  <p>
  We point out the model's weaknesses and we introduce other models as
  needed to deal with different problems.

  The idea is to use the simplest model adequate for designing
  algorithms. 


  

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">What are the most serious limitations of the
  model?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model is inadequate for analyzing the performance of
  algorithms. 

  <p>
  This is because the model is inherently sequential whereas distributed systems are
  inherently concurrent.

  In the model, at most one agent is active at a time while all other agents are
  idle.

  Let's look at one consequence of this assumption.

  <p>
  Consider a distributed system in which an
  agent executes a <code>receive</code> that includes the statement
  <code>time.sleep(1)</code> that causes the agent to sleep (do
  nothing) for 1 second.

  We may want an agent to sleep after it sends a message and before it
  sends the next message to reduce congestion and improve performance.

  <p>
  The model cannot represent this situation.

  In the model only one agent executes <code>receive</code> at a time.
  
  So, if an agent sleeps for a second while executing
  <code>receive</code> then -- in effect -- all agents sleep for a second.

  <p>
  We discuss the use of local clocks when we discuss system
performance.

We do not use clocks for proving that algorithms are correct.
  


  
    
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can you represent systems in which agents
  are created and deleted in the model?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  The model doesn't have features that allow agents to be created and
  deleted.

<p>
  You may want to implement a system in which agents are created and
  deleted infinitely often, and so create and delete an unbounded
  number of agents.

  In this case the network of agents changes over time in an arbitrary
  fashion. 

  This model doesn't represent such systems.

  <p>
  The implementations and software libraries given in this course
  allow agents to be created.

  The implementation platforms are more powerful than the model.

  In this course we don't need use all features of these platforms. 


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can an agent refuse to receive a message?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
In this model an agent cannot refuse to receive a message.

<p>
 You may want to design an algorithm in which an agent
  <code>X</code> refuses to receive messages from an agent
  <code>Z</code> until it first receives a message from an agent
  <code>Y</code>.

In our model, agent <code>X</code> has to receive the message from
  <code>Z</code> in every state of <code>X</code>.

  <p>
  Agent <code>X</code> can copy the message from <code>Z</code> into a
  local queue -- a local 
  variable of <code>X</code> -- and process the local queue later.



  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can a full channel block a sender from
  sending more messages?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
In the model a sender is never blocked from sending a message.

<p>
Some implementations of queues specify a maximum size, and when the
queue is full, agents cannot append messages to the queue.

Our model assumes that queues that represent messages in channels can
be of arbitrary size, and so a sender is never blocked from sending
more messages in a channel.

<p>
We will, however, prove that the number of messages in a channel is
bounded by some number, and so we need only ensure that queue sizes are
large enough.



  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">How do you represent channels that are not
  first in first out?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
We use queues to represent states of first in first out channels, and
  we use other data structures -- such as multisets -- to represent
  states of other types of channels. 

<p>
Later we describe algorithms with different types of channels.

  For example, the state of a channel in which messages may overtake
  each other is a multiset or bag.

  A message is sent on a channel by adding the message to the
  multiset.

  A nonempty multiset may deliver any message in the mutliset to the
  receiving agent.

  <p>
  Lossy channels, and channels in which messages have priorities, are
  also modeled by defining channel states appropriately.

        
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent sequential
  composition of distributed computations?</p>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Yes.

<p>
There are problems in which we would like to start a distributed
computation <code>P</code>; wait for <code>P</code> to finish, and
then start another distributed computation <code>Q</code>.

We want a barrier between <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.

<p>
A barrier can be implemented in several ways.

An agent, say a <i>coordinator</i> agent, sends messages to all agents to start
<code>P</code>.

The coordinator then detects termination of <code>P</code>; we discuss
termination detection algorithms later.

After detecting termination of <code>P</code> the coordinator sends
messages to all agents to start <code>Q</code>.
  
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Can the model represent agents that make state transitions
  without receiving messages? </p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
No, the model does not represent agents that make state transitions
without receiving messages.

The effect of a state transition without receiving a message can be
simulated by an agent sending itself a message and carrying out the
transition when it receives a message from itself.

<p>
Some books on distributed systems allow agents to make <i>internal</i>
  state transitions -- these are transitions without receiving
messages.

For example, an agent that is computing using a set of files may
  transition to a state in which it no longer needs those files; this
transition occurs without the agent receiving a message.

Can the model represent such internal state transitions?

<p>
Internal state transitions are represented by transitions in which an
agent receives a message from itself.

  We represent an internal state change by having the agent
  send a message to itself; the agent makes a state change when it
receives the message.

<p>
For example, an agent that is computing using a set of files sends a
message "<i>finished using files</i>" to itself, and when the message
arrives, the agent changes state to one in which it no longer using
the files.

  <p>
  Representing internal state changes in this way is an artifice;
  however, the artifice allows us to use a simple model in which a
  state change occurs only when a message is delivered.


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Local clocks can be synchronized using NTP
  and other protocols. Why do you assume that clocks aren't synchronized? </p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
Local clocks can, indeed, be synchronized very accurately; however, we
  do not assume that they are perfect.

<p>
We use agents' local clocks for evaluating algorithm performance but
not for proving correctness because even a small drift can cause race
conditions. 

<p>
Consider an algorithm in which one agent carries out a computation
starting at 1pm and another agent carries out a computation starting at 2pm.

When we prove the correctness of our algorithms, we allow for the
unlikely possibility that that the agent starting its 
computation at 2pm does so before the agent that starts a 1pm.

For evaluating performance, however, we assume that the agent that starts a 1pm
usually does so before the agent that starts at 2pm.
