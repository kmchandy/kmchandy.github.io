  </p>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  This webpage reviews properties of directed acyclic graphs and
  dataflow graphs, and introduces concepts of past and future in
  slices of dataflow graphs.
  </p>


  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Directed Acyclic Graphs: Review</h4> 
  <!---------------------------------------------------------->

We begin with a review of a few basic properties of directed acyclic
  graphs and dataflow.


  The figure below is an example of a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">
  directed acyclic graph
  </a>,
  abbreviated to dag.

  <figure>
    <img src="DistributedSystemModels/DistributedSystemModels.014.jpeg"
    alt="Fig14" style="width:75%"> 
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Example of a Directed Acyclic Graph</figcaption>
  </figure>

  

  <!-------------------------------------------------------->  
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Topological Sort</h5>
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->

  
<a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
  A topological sort
  </a>
  of a dag is a sequence of vertices of the dag in which each vertex \(u\) appears in
  the sequence after all vertices that have paths to \(u\).
  
  Examples of topological sorts of the dag shown in figure 1 are \([0,
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\) and \([0, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7]\).

  <p>
  An example of a sequence that is not a topological sort is
  \([0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]\).

  There is a path from vertex 2 to vertex 3, but 2 does not appear
  before 3 in the sequence.


  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
   <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Closed Set of Vertices</h5>
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->  
  A subset \(H\) of vertices of a dag is <i>
  closed</i> exactly when every edge to every vertex in \(H\) is from a
  vertex in \(H\).

  There is no path to a vertex in a closed set from a
  vertex outside it.
  
  There may, however, be paths from vertices in a closed
  set to vertices outside it.

<p>
Examples of vertex sets that are closed are \(\{0, 1, 2\}\),
and  \(\{0, 1, 2, 5\}\).

An example of a vertex set that is not closed is \(\{0, 1,
3\}\) because there is an edge to vertex \(3\) from vertex \(2\) which
is not in the set.


  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h5>
  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
Let \(V\) be the set of vertices.

For a closed subsets \(H, H'\) of vertices of a dag,  where \(H
\subseteq H'\)
the concatenation of topological sorts of \(H\),  \(H' - H\), and  \(V
- H'\) is a topological sort of the dag. 

<p>
In figure 1, \(H = \{0, 1, 2, 5\}\)
and \(H' = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
are closed, and the sequence
\([0, 2, 1, 5]\) followed by \([3, 4]\) followed by
\([6, 7]\) is a topological sort of the dag.



  <!---------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Dataflow: Review</h4> 
<!---------------------------------------------------------->

Next we review properties of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">
dataflow
</a>
that help in understanding distributed computing algorithms.

<p>
  A vertex of a dataflow graph is an operation on variables of a
  computation. 

  A directed edge connects the output of an operation to the input
  of another operation.

  An edge is labeled with the data that is transferred between
  operations.

  We restrict attention to acyclic dataflow graphs.

<p>
  A computation of a dataflow graph is an execution (possibly a
  parallel execution) of operations of the graph where:
  <i>
  an operation \(v\) is executed only after all
  operations that have paths to \(v\) in the dataflow graph.
  </i>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of Dataflow</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The figure 2 is an example of a dataflow graph.

The vertices are operations, \(+. *, -\), and the edges show the
formula of the data on the edge.

The initial vertex generates the variables of the dataflow.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->  
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Properties of Dataflow</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->

The following observations follow directly from properties of directed
acyclic graphs.

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
<ol>
  <li>
  <h6 style="color:blue;">
  All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
  topological sorts</a> of dataflow graphs are computations.
  And all sequential computations are topological sorts of a dataflow
  graph. 
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h6 style="color:blue;">
  For all closed sets \(H, H'\) of operations where \(H
\subseteq H'\) there exists a computation that executes all operations
in \(H\), then executes operations in \(H' - H\), and then executes
  operations that are not in \(H'\).
  </h6>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr class="new2">




<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">
Example: Topological Sorts of Dataflow Graphs are Computations
</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
Examples of topological sorts of the operations in figure 2 are \([-,
+, *]\), \([+, -, *]\), and \([+, *, -]\).
All these sequences of operations have the property that each operation
is executed only after all operations that have paths to it in the
dataflow graph.

<p>
An example of a sequence which is not a topological sort is \([*, +,
-]\).

<p>
An example of a closed set of operations is \(\{-, +\}\), and
an example of a set that is not closed is \(\{-, *\}\).

<p>
Let \(H = \{-\}\) and \(H' = \{-, +\}\).

There exists a sequence of
operations that executes operations in \(H\) and then those that are
in \(H' - H\), and then the remaining operations.



<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Slice of a Dataflow Graph</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
A computation of an agent is a sequence of events at that agent.

A point in the computation of an agent \(u\) is specified by an
integer \(i\) and is the 
edge from the \(i\)-th event at \(u\) to the \(i+1\)-th event at
\(u\).

<p>

A <i>slice</i> of a dataflow graph of a computation is a vector \(N\)
where \(N[k]\) 
is a point in the \(k\)-th agent's computation.

<p>
The <i>past</i> at the slice  is defined
as the set consisting of the first \(N[k]\) events of the \(k\)-th
agent. 

The <i>future</i> at the slice is the
complement of the past. 



<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: Past, and Future</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
Figure 3 shows a dataflow graph for a computation with events
\([0, 1, 2, \ldots]\) and agents \(X, Y, Z\) indexed \(0, 1, 2\)
respectively. 

<p>
Points on the agents' computations are shown as yellow circles.
For example, the point on agent \(X\) is 3 because it is the edge from
the 3rd event (event number 6) to the 4th event (event number 8) at
\(X\).

<p>
The purple line connecting the points represents the
slice \([3, 3, 2]\).

<figure>
    <img src="../ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.009.jpeg"
    alt="Fig3" style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.3: Example: Past and Future
</figcaption>
</figure>

The set of past events are colored black and the set of future events
are colored green.





<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem about Past and Future</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
The following result is self-evident from the definition of
closed sets.
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
The past at a slice is closed if any of the following hold.
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="color:blue;">
Each message received in a past event is sent in a past event.
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="color:blue;">
Each message sent in a future event is received in a future event.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  For all channels \(C\),  \(\; C_{s} \geq C_{r}\), where \(C_{s}, C_{r}\)
  are the numbers of messages 
  sent and received (respectively) on the channel in past
  events.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<hr class="new2">


  In graphical terms, the past is closed if all edges that cross the
  boundary separating past and future events in the dataflow graph are
  directed from the past to the future.


<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The State at a Slice</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

A slice is closed exactly when the past at the slice is closed.

The state at a closed slice is the state after executing all events in
the past and before executing any event in the future.

<p>
The state \(S\) at a closed slice is given by the labels of edges of
the dataflow graph from the past to the future.

<ol>
  <li>
The state of an agent \(u\) in \(S\) is the label of the
  edge from an event at \(u\) in the past to an event at \(u\) in the
  future. 
  </li>
  <li>

The state of a channel \((u, v)\) in \(S\) is the sequence of labels
of \((u, v)\) edges from events in the past to events in the future.
  </li>
</ol>


From property 2 of dataflow graphs:
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
For closed slices \(U, V\) where \(U \leq V\):
there is a computation from the state at \(U\) to the state at \(V\).
</p>
<hr class="new2">

In figure 3 there is a computation from the slice \([3, 3, 2]\) to
the slice \([4, 4, 2]\).

<p>
The remainder of this page consists of examples.


<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 style="color:red;">Examples</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: Past is not Closed</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
The next figure shows a slice \([1, 4, 3]\) which is not closed.


<figure>
    <img src="../ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.010.jpeg"
    alt="Fig4" style="width:100%"> 
<figcaption>
Fig.4: Example: Slice is not Closed
</figcaption>
</figure>

The slice is not closed because there is a message sent in the future
(event 4) that is received in the past (event 5).


<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: State at a Slice</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p>
In figure 5, the agents \(u, v\) are indexed \(0, 1\), respectively.

Let's look at the state \(S_{3}\) at the slice \([2, 3]\)
in the figure.

This is the state after executing events \(0, 1, 2, 3\).

<p>
The past at the slice is \(H = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

The slice is represented by the vertical line between events 3 and 4.

The slice is a boundary between the past and future.

State \(S_{3}\) is determined by the labels of edges that cross the
boundary.

<p>
The boundary line intersects the agent edge for
\(u\) at an edge with label "e" signifying empty; so, \(u\) holds no tokens in
\(S_{3}\).

The line intersects the edges for channel \((v, u)\) at a single edge
and that edge has label "red token" and so the state of the \((v, u)\)
in \(S_{3}\) is a sequence of messages consisting of a single message
-- the red token.

<p>

The boundary line does not intersect an edge for the channel \((u, v)\), and so
the state of this channel is the empty sequence of messages.

The line intersects message edges for messages on channel \((v, v)\)
at a single edge; this edge is labeled with the wakeup message.

So, the state of channel \((v, v)\) is a sequence consisting of a single
message -- the wakeup message.

<p>
The states of other agents and channels are determined similarly.


<p>
The state \(S_{i}\) that occurs in a computation after events \(0,
\ldots, i\) are obtained similarly and are shown in figure 3.

The lower part of figure 3 shows the dataflow graph and
the upper part shows the sequence of states in the
computation.

The dotted vertical lines show boundaries of the slices.

Fig.4: Example: States at Closed Slices
</figcaption>
</figure>




<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">Example: State at a Slice</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
Let's look at the state at slice \([3, 2]\).

The past of the slice is \(\{0, 1, 2, 5\}\).

The state of \(u\) is the label of the edge from event 5 to 6 -- holds
red token.

The state of \(v\) is the label of the edge from event 2 to 3 -- holds
no token.

The slice boundary cuts the message edge from 1 to 3.

This edge is labeled with blue token; so the state of channel \((u,
v)\) is blue token.

The boundary does not intersect with other edges, and so that states
of the remaining channels are empty sequences.



<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 style="color:red;">
Example: Topological Sorts of Dataflow Graphs are Computations
</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>


Figure 5 shows different computations \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, N]\) and
\([0, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6, N]\) with the same dataflow graph.

Both computations are topological sorts of the graph.

In the figure, events of the graph are laid out from left to
right in the order in which they occur in the computations.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Computations between Slices</h4>

There exists a computation from the slice \([0, 2]\) to the slice
\([3, 2]\).

applications of slices.
