<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Computations</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  A computation is a sequential representation of the execution of a
  distributed system.

  We use techniques for proving sequential programs to prove
  properties of computations and thus prove properties of distributed
  systems.




 
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Sequential Programming Representation</h3>
  <!----------------------------------------------->
A timeline is representation of an execution of a distributed system;
a dataflow is an abstraction of a timeline.
Next, we look at a sequential programming abstraction of a distributed
  system.

  <p>
  Consider a sequential program consisting of an initialization (not
  shown) and the following <code>while</code> loop.


<pre>
while there exists a nonempty channel in the system:
   select a nonempty channel (u, v)
   let the head of channel (u, v) be msg
   v executes receive(msg, u)
</pre>


<p>
Execution of the while loop terminates in a state in which all
channels are empty.

If there are multiple nonempty channels in an iteration then any
nonempty channel is selected.

  We discuss fairness in selection later in the course.

  Each iteration of the while loop executes a single event.

  Another representation of the loop is:
  
<pre>
while there exists an event that can be executed:
   execute any executable event
  </pre>
  
  Each iteration of the while loop causes a state transition by
  changing the state of one 
  agent and the states of channels incident on that agent.

  Next we define computations and relate the sequential program to
  computations. 


   
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computations</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

  A computation is a sequence of one or more states,
\([S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots]\) where the initial state, \(S_{0}\) of the
sequence is an initial state of the system and where there exists an
event at an agent of the system that causes a transition from each
state in the sequence to the next.

A computation may be finite or infinite.

<p>
A computation can also be specified by an initial state, \(S_{0}\), and a sequence
of events \([e_{0}, e_{1}, \ldots, ]\) where execution of the \(i\)-th
event \(e_{i}\) causes a transition from the \(i\)-th to the \(i+1\)-th state of the
computation.


<p>
A <i>step</i> of the computation is an execution of a single event in this
sequence.

The same event -- specified by the 4-tuple that defines a state
transition -- can occur multiple times in a computation.

So, different steps may be executions of the same event.




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Relationship between Computations and a While Loop</h4>
Let \(S_{0}\) be the state before execution of the while loop and let
\(S_{i}\) be the state upon completion of the \(i\)-th iteration of
the loop for \(i > 0\).

<pre>
while there exists an event that can be executed:
   execute any executable event
  </pre>

The sequence of states \([S_{0}, S_{1}, \ldots, ]\)
is a computation.

The while loop may not terminate and a computation may be infinite.

<p>
The advantage of using a while loop to generate the states 
of a computation is that we can use familiar techniques for reasoning about
while loops to reason about distributed algorithms.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Reasoning about While Loops: Loop Invariants and Loop Variants</p>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">
  loop invariant</a>
  is an assertion about the state of the program that holds before and
after each iteration of the loop.

We use invariants to prove that all states in an execution of a
distributed system have some property, such as all states are safe.

<p>
We prove that some desired property holds at some point in the
execution of a while loop by using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant">
loop variants</a>, also called variant functions or metrics.
Methods for proving progress properties are given later.




  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Relationship between Computations and Dataflow</h3>
<!----------------------------------------------->

Associated with each computation is a dataflow that has the same steps
as the computation.

A computation is a <i>sequence</i> of steps whereas a dataflow is a <i>partial
ordering</i> on steps.

A computation has exactly one dataflow associated with it.

A dataflow may have multiple computations associated with it.

<p>
We adopt the following convention in diagrams of of computations.

We depict a computation by a dataflow graph with earlier steps in the
computation appearing to the left of later steps in the computation.

Figure 4 shows computations \([1, 2, 3, 4]\) and \([2, 1, 3, 4]\).
Both computations have the same dataflow.

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Topological Sorts of Directed Acyclic Graphs</p>
<!----------------------------------------------->
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
  topological sort</a> of a directed acyclic graph is a sequence of
  vertices of the graph where every edge \((e, e')\) in the graph,
\(e\) appears before \(e'\) in the sequence.

<p>
For example, \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, N]\) and \([0, 2, 1, 3, 4, N]\) are
topological sorts of the graph shown in figure 4.
\([0, 1, 3, 2, 4, N]\) is not a topological sort because the graph has
an edge \((2, 3)\) and \(3\) appears before \(2\) in the sequence.
For similar reasons, \([0, 1, 2, 4, 3, N]\) is not a topological sort.


<hr class="new2">  
  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h4 style="color:blue;">Theorem</h4>
<!----------------------------------------------->

<p style="color:blue;">

All topological sorts of a dataflow graph are computations.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

The initial state is the state after the initial step (step 0) at
each agent.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>

Let \(z\) be a topological sort of  a dataflow graph \(G\).

We will prove by induction on \(n\) that \(z_{n}\), the sequence
consisting of the first \(n\) elements of \(z\) is a computation.

The base case is \(n = 0\).

Let the \(n+1\)-th element of \(z\) be vertex \(v\).

Let this vertex represent a step at an agent \(a\) in which \(a\)
receives a message \(m\) on a channel \(c\), and the state of \(a\)
before the step is \(s\).

<p>
Because \(z\) is a topological sort:
<ol>
  <li>
  \(z_{n}\) consists of vertices with paths to \(v\). So the state of
  agent \(a\) before \(v\) in \(G\) is \(s\).
  </li>
  <li>
  The step in which message \(m\) is sent is in \(z_{n}\), and all
  messages received by \(a\) on channel \(c\) prior to \(m\) are also
  in \(z_{n}\). So after \(z_{n}\) the state of \(c\) has \(m\) at its
  head.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Therefore there is a step in  which \(a\)
receives a message \(m\) on a channel \(c\), and the state of \(a\)
before the step is \(s\).



  <!----------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Alternate Version of the Theorem</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->
A computation</a> is a sequence of steps of a dataflow graph in which for all edges
  \((e, e')\) in the graph:
  <center>\(e\) occurs before \(e'\) in the
  sequence.
  </center>

This page describes the model of distributed systems that we use to
design most of the algorithms in this course.

You may wonder how a model as simple as a sequential while loop that
ignores critical features of time evolution of system state
can be useful.

This course give examples of algorithms designed using this
and other models.
