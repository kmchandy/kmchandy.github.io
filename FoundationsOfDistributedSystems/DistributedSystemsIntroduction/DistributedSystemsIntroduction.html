    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Distributed Systems: Introduction</h2>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
channels, and is represented by a labeled directed graph in which vertices
  represent agents and labeled directed edges represent named
  channels.
  <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    The figure below shows a distributed system with agents A, B, C, and
    channels r, t, u, v, x, y, z. The figure shows that there can be
    multiple channels from one agent to another; for example, the
    channels called t and x are both from agent C to agent B.

    <figure>
    <img src="Channels_2.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:50%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Graph Representation of a Distributed Systems</figcaption>
  </figure>
  In the graph, an edge labeled \(z\) directed from a vertex \(A\)
  represents a channel \(z\) directed from agent \(A\).
  Likewise, an edge labeled \(r\) towards vertex \(A\)
  represents a channel \(r\) directed towards agent \(A\).

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Agent State</p>
  Each agent has a set of variables that are local to the agent;
  other agents and channels cannot access these variables.
  The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Channels</p>
  Consider a channel \(c\) directed from an agent \(A\) to an agent \(B\):
  Agent \(A\) can send messages along \(c\), and agent \(B\) can
  receive messages along \(c\).
  \(c\).

  <p>
  We will study different types of channels in this course.
  Messages may get lost, or messages may overtake
  earlier messages, in some channel types.
  The type of channel that we will study in the next several chapters is one in which
  all messages sent are delivered; messages are delivered in the order
  sent; and message delays are arbitrary (but finite).
  This type of channel is a model of message-passing using the TCP
  protocol.

  
  <p>
The state of this type of channel is a sequence of messages; these are
the messages in the channel.
When an agent sends a message along a channel the message is
appended to the tail of the sequence of messages in the channel.
A nonempty channel removes the message at the head of the sequence of
messages in the channel and delivers it to the receiving agent.

  <p class="w3-text-teal">System State</p>
  The state of a system is given by the states of its agents and
channels.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions</h4>
State transitions are called events. A distributed system changes
state in only two ways:
<ol>
  <li> A message is delivered to an agent.
  </li>
  <li>
  An agent changes state without receiving messages.
  </li>
  <ol>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Delivery Event</p>
A message in a non-empty channel can be delivered to an agent
  independent of the state of the agent or the messages in the
  channel.
  The receiving agent cannot block a channel from delivering a
  message.
  A receiving agent may have mailboxes or other data structures into which
  messages are delivered; the states of these data structures are parts
  of the state of the receiving agent.

  <p>
  When an agent receives a message the agent may change the values of
  its variables and send messages on the agent's outgoing
  channels. The next state of the agent depends only on the message
  that the agent receives, the channel that delivers the message, and
  the agent's state when it receives the message.
  
<p class="w3-text-teal">Internal Event</p>
An agent may change its state without receiving a message. For
    example, an agent may wait for some time (as determined by the
    agent's local clock) to receive an acknowledgment to a message
    that it has sent, and take action if an acknowledgment is not
    received. 




<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Model of Computation</h3>
The model of computation we reviewed earlier is that of the <i>do - od
</i> loop: Computation progresses by executing any guarded command
whose guard evaluates to True. The model of computation for
distributed systems is similar: Computation progresses by delivering a
message from any channel that is not empty. There is one major
difference: <i>fairness.</i>
