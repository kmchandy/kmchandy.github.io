    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Distributed Systems: Introduction</h2>
  <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of message-passing
channels. It is represented by a labeled directed graph in which vertices
  represent agents and labeled directed edges represent named
  channels.
  <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    The figure below shows a distributed system with agents A, B, C.

    <figure>
    <img src="Channels_2.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:50%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Graph Representation of a Distributed Systems</figcaption>
  </figure>
  An edge labeled \(z\) directed from a vertex \(A\) to
    a vertex \(B\)
represents a channel \(z\) directed from agent \(A\) to agent \(B\).

A channel  \(z\) from an agent \(A\) to an agent \(B\) is called an
<i>outgoing</i> channel of \(A\) and an <i>incoming</i> channel of \(B\).

  <p class="w3-text-teal">Agent State</p>
  Each agent has a set of variables that are <i>local</i> to the agent;
other agents and channels cannot access these variables.
The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.
<p>
Agent's may have local clocks; however, clocks are not perfectly
  synchronized. The instant at which one agent's clock reads 1200 may be
  before, after, or at the same instant at which a different clock
reads 1200.
We will discuss clock synchronization in later modules.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Channels</p>
  We will study different types of channels in this course.
  Messages may get lost, or messages may overtake
  earlier messages, in some channel types.
  The type of channel that we will study in this module and in the next several chapters
is a model of message-passing using the TCP
protocol; we describe this channel next.

<p>
An agent can send messages on its outgoing channels and receive
messages on its incoming channels.
All messages sent are delivered; messages are delivered in the order
sent; and message delays are arbitrary (but finite).

  
<p class="w3-text-teal">Channel State</p>
The state of a channel is a sequence of messages; these are
the messages in the channel.
When an agent sends a message along a channel the message is
appended to the tail of the sequence of messages in the channel.
A nonempty channel removes the message at the head of the sequence of
messages in the channel and delivers it to the receiving agent.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">System States and Transitions</h4>
  The state of a system is given by the states of its agents and
channels. A system changes
state in only two ways:
<ol>
  <li> A message \(m\) at the head of a channel \(c\) which is directed
  towards an agent \(B\) is delivered to \(B\). Message \(m\) is
  removed from channel \(c\). The state of agent \(B\) may change, and
  \(B\) may send messages when it receives the message.
  </li>
  <li>
  An agent changes state without receiving messages.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Delivery Event</p>
A message in a non-empty channel is delivered to an agent
independent of the state of the system.
An agent does not block a channel from delivering a message.
A receiving agent may have mailboxes or other data structures into which
messages are delivered; the states of these data structures are parts
of the state of the receiving agent.

<p>
When an agent receives a message the agent may change the values of
its variables and send messages on the agent's outgoing
channels. The next state of the agent and the messages sent by the
    agent depend only on the message
  that the agent receives, the channel that delivers the message, and
  the agent's state when it receives the message.
  
<p class="w3-text-teal">Internal Event</p>
An agent may change its state without receiving a message. For
example, an agent may take action if it does not receive a
message in some time (determined by the agent's local clock).
An internal event may change the state of the agent and send messages on the
    agent's outgoing channels.
    The next state of the agent and the messages sent by the
    agent depend only on the state of the agent prior to the transition.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Model of Computation</h3>
    We described the <i>do - od</i> loop and nondeterministic
    iteration in an earlier module.
    The model of computation for distributed systems is also the <i>do
    - od</i> loop with one difference ---  <i>fairness</i> --- which
    we will describe later in this module.
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Message Delivery Event</p>
    Each channel has one guarded command associated with it.
    Execution of the action of this guarded command delivers a message
    from this channel.
    The guard is that the channel is non-empty.
Execution of the action delivers the message in the channel and may
    change the values of 
the agent's variables and send messages on the agent's outgoing
    channels.

    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Internal Event</p>
    Each agent has a single guarded command associated with it,
where the guard is a predicate on states of the agent and
execution of the action is an internal event of the agent.
    Here is an example of a guarded command for an agent with
variables <code>x, y</code>.
<pre>
x < y  ->  (y = x; send y on channel c)
</pre>
The guard may be the constant <code>False</code> in which case the
corresponding action is never executed.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines</h4>
We first show how timelines represent computations and
then discuss fairness.
