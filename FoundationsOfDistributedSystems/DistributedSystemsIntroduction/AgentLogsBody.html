<h2 class="w3-text-teal">From Agent Logs to System Trajectories</h2>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
The theorem in the
<a href="/Timelines.html">Timelines module</a> is important and should be
viewed in multiple ways. One way is as follows. Suppose each agent
logs the sequence of events at that agent, i.e., the agent logs its
state before and after each of its event, the message (if any) received in the
event, and the messages (if any) sent in the event. In terms of a
timeline diagram, each agent records the labeled edges directed towards
and away from each of the agent's events (see figure below).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4>
Given the logs of all the agents how can we determine the trajectory
of the entire system --- the sequence of global states of the system?

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
The figure below shows logs of each of the three agents in the example
given in the Timelines module.

</figure>
What are the ways in which these agent logs can be stitched together
to get a log of the trajectory of the global system?
In the Timelines module we saw at least two ways of composing the
agent logs. The two timelines are given again below

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Requirement for Composing Agent Logs</h4>
The theorem tells us that the only requirement is:

<p class="w3-text-teal">
Each message is received only <i>after</i> it is sent.
</p>

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
Here is another timeline diagram that satisfies this requirement.
