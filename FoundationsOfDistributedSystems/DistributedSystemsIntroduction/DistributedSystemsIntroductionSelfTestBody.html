    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h2>
    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->

    A system has two agents \(A\) and \(B\), and channels \(x\), \(y\)
    from agent \(A\) to agent \(B\), and channel \(z\) from \(B\) to
    \(A\).
    <p>
    The system has four indivisible tokens with ids 0, 1, 2, 3. Tokens
    are indivisible and cannot be created or destroyed. A token's id
    remains unchanged.
    <p>
    Initially channel \(x\) contains tokens with ids 0, 1, 2 with id 0
    ahead of id 1 ahead of id 2. Initially channel \(z\) contains the
    token with id 3. Initially channel \(y\) is empty, and initially agents
    \(A\) and \(B\) hold no tokens.

    </figure>
    <p>
    Agent \(A\)'s actions are as follows. When it receives a token
    with id 0, 1, or 2 it sends the token immediately on channel
    \(x\).
    When it receives a token with id 3, agent \(A\) immediately sends
    the token on channel \(y\).
    <p>
    When agent \(B\) receives a token it immediately sends the token
    out on channel \(z\).
    <p>
    True or False? The very first token token that \(B\) receives has
    id 0.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 2</h2>
    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    Consider the same system as in question 1.
    <p>
    True or False? There is a system trajectory (starting from the
    initial state) that reaches a state in which channel \(z\)
    contains: first the token with id 0, then the token with id 2, and then the
    token with id 1. The state is shown in the diagram below.

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    Consider the same system as in question 1.
    <p>
    True or False? There is a system trajectory (starting from the
    initial state) that reaches a state in which channel \(z\)
    contains: first the token with id 2, then the token with id 3, and then the
    token with id 0.The state is shown in the diagram below.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 4</h2>
    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    Consider the same system as in question 1.
    <p>
    Let \(P\) be the predicate: channel \(y\) contains
    the token with id 3 OR channel \(z\) contains
the token with id 3. Let \(init\) be the predicate that defines the
    initial state. 
<p>
True or False?
\(
[init \; \Rightarrow \; always(P)]
\)

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 5</h2>
    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    Consider the same system as in question 1.
    <p>
Let \(P\) be the predicate specifying that channel \(z\)
    contains: first the token with id 2, then the token with id 3, and then the
    token with id 0, and channel \(x\) contains the token with id
1. The state that satisfies \(P\) is shown in Fig. 3.
<p>
Let \(Q\) be the predicate which specifies that channel \(z\)
    contains the token with id 3, and then the
    token with id 0, and and channel \(x\) contains the token with id
    1 followed by the token with id 2. This state is shown in the
figure below.

    Test Answers</h1>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 1</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
False.
<p>
The token with id 3 can move from channel \(z\) to channel \(y\) and
    then be received by agent \(B\) before tokens in channel \(x\) are
delivered to \(B\). So, the token with id 3 may be received first.

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 2</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
False
<p>
The state of a channel is a queue. The order in which messages are
    received along a channel is the same as the order in which
    messages are sent along the channel. So, the tokens in
channel \(z\) have to follow the cyclic order
<br>
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ....
<br>
interspersed with token with id 3.

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 3</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
True
<p>
Same reasoning as for question 2.

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 4</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
True
<p>
\(P\) holds in all states in all trajectories that start in an
    initial state, and therefore \([init \; \Rightarrow \; always(P)]\).

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 5</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
False.
<p>
Recall that \(next(P)\) holds for a state \(s\) exactly when in
<i>all</i> paths from \(s\) the next state satisfies \(P\).
Equivalently, \(next(P)\) holds for a state \(s\) exactly when in
<i>all</i> transitions from \(s\) are to states in which \(P\) holds.
The key point is "<i>all</i> transitions" as opposed to "<i>there exists</i> 
transitions."
<p>
In terms of Computation Tree Logic, \(next(P) = AX(P)\)
    where \(A\) stands for <i>all</i> and \(X\) stands for
    \(neXt\).
<p>
So, the question is this: Are <i>all</i> transitions from the state
shown in fig. 3 to the state shown in fig. 4?

<p>
The answer to this question is <i>No</i> because
there exists a transtion from the
state shown in fig. 3 to the state shown in fig. 5. This transition
occurs when the token with id 0 on channel \(x\) is received by agent \(B\) and put on
channel \(z\).

<p>
So not <i>all</i> transitions from states in which \(P\) holds are to
states in which \(Q\) holds.
