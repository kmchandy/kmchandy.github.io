<!--------------------------------------------------------->
A <i>timeline</i> diagram depicts the evolution of a <i>single</i>
trajectory over time.  In a timeline diagram, the horizontal (i.e. x-)
axis represents time.  Each agent has its own timeline which shows the
evolution of states of that agent. An agent's timeline is represented
by a horizontal line; the state of an agent \(B\) at time t is
represented by the point, at time \(t\), on \(B\)'s line. A state
transition of an agent is called an <i>event at that agent.</i>

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: A Timeline Diagram</figcaption>
  </figure>
In the figure the blue horizontal lines are the timelines for agents
\(A\) and \(B\). The blue circles numbered 1, 3, 5 on the timeline for
agent \(A\) represent events at agent \(A\); likewise, blue circles
numbered 2, 4 on the timeline for agent \(B\) represent \(B\)'s
events. An event can be an internal state transition, which is one
without receiving messages. An example of an internal event is event 1
on the timeline for agent \(A\). Events 2, 3, 4, 5 are receive-message
events.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Timelines</p>
A message sent by an agent \(A\) at time \(t\) and received by agent
\(B\) at time \(t'\) is represented by a straight line starting at
point \(t\) on \(A\)'s timeline and ending at point \(t'\) on \(B\)'s
timeline; this line is the timeline for the message. In the diagram,
agent \(A\) sends messages \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1}\), while agent \(B\)
sends messages \(r_{0}\) and \(r_{1}\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Channel States in Timeline Diagrams</p>
The state of a channel \(c\) at time \(T\) is the sequence (in time
order) of messages that are sent along \(c\) before \(T\) and that are
received after \(T\).

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
<figure>
    <img src="Timelines/Timelines.002.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Global State from a Timeline Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

The next diagram shows how the global state of the system --- the
states of all agents and channels --- at time \(T\) are represented in
the timeline diagram.  The diagram shows timelines for agents \(A, B,
D\). Agent \(A\) sends messages \(m_{0}\) along a channel \(c'\) and
\(m_{1}\) along a different channel \(c\) at event 1.  When agent \(D\)
receives \(m_{0}\) at event 2 it sends message \(r_{0}\) to \(A\).
When agent \(A\) receives \(r_{0}\) at event 3 it sends message
\(m_{2}\) to \(B\) along channel \(c\).

<p>
In the diagram, the state of \(c\) is the sequence of \(c\)-message
lines that are cut by the vertical line at \(T\); these are the
message lines for \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) in that order. The state of
an agent \(A\) at \(T\) is, likewise, the state on \(A\)'s timeline at
the point where the timeline is cut by the vertical line at \(T\).  The global
state of the system at T is obtained from the points at which agent
timelines and message lines are cut by the vertical line at \(T\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Properties of Timeline Diagrams</p>
The properties of a timeline diagram depend on the assumptions we make
about channels and agents. Let's look at some examples of assumptions
and their consequences. Suppose all messages sent along a channel c
from agent B to agent D are delayed by at least T and at most T' time
units. The top diagram in the figure below shows a message (red line)
that is delivered with a delay between T and T'. The lower diagram
shows a message that is delivered with a delay outstide the (T, T')
interval, and so this diagram does not represent a trajectory of this
system.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Takeaway</p>
A timeline is a familiar concept that help us to understand the
behavior of multi-agent systems.
