    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Foundations Of Distributed Systems</h2>
    This chapter describes concepts at the foundation of distributed
    systems.
    These concepts are extensions of concepts in sequential
    programming. 

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents and Channels as Vertices and Edges</h4>
    Distributed systems are defined in terms of their states and state
    transitions.

    <a href="Safety/Safety.html">Safety</a>
    shows how states and state transitions are represented as vertices
    and edges of directed graphs.
    
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Safety</h4>
    We have to prove that distributed systems remain forever in
    <i>safe</i> states.
    <a href="Safety/Safety.html">Safety</a> shows that we prove this
    by showing that safety is invariant: Initial 
    states are safe and all transitions from safe states are to safe
    states.

    <p>
    Distributed systems are defined as sets of agents
    and communication channels between agents.
    <a
    href="DistributedSystemsIntroduction/DistributedSystemsIntroduction.html">
    Distributed Systems Introduction
    </a>
    discusses representation of agents and channels as vertices and
    edges, respectively, of directed graphs.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">System Timelines</h4>
    <a
    href="Channels/Channels.html">
    Timelines
    </a>
    show how the state of a system evolves over time.
    Timelines are a useful concept in designing distributed
    algorithms.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Progress: Introduction</h4>
    We prove that trajectories or computations of distributed systems
    progress towards their goals by using a concept, called <i>leads
    to</i> from temporal logic.
    <a
    href="Progress/Progress.html">
    Progress
    </a>
    defines this concept and discusses how we use CTL (computation
    tree logic) to prove correctness.
    The emphasis throughout this website is on the similarity of
    concepts in sequential and distributed algorithms, and we show how
    concepts such as invariants and variant functions are used to
prove safety and progress.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Rules to Prove Progress</h4>
<a
    href="ProgressProperties/ProgressProperties.html">
    Progress Properties
</a>
gives three simple rules that we use to prove that distributed systems
progress towards their goals.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
This chapter introduces the simple, central concepts of distributed
algorithms.
These concepts are based on properties of paths in directed graphs and
are extensions of concepts from sequential programming.
