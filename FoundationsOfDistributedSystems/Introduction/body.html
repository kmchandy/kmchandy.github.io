    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Foundations Of Distributed Systems</h2>
    This chapter describes foundational concepts of distributed
systems.
<p>
The module on agents and channels describes:
<ol>
  <li>
  the specification of distributed systems as directed graph in which
  vertices represent agents and edges represent channels, and
  </li>
  <li>
  computations of distributed system defined as executions of
  nondeterministic loops described in the previous chapter.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The next module on timelines shows how the computation of a
distributed system can be defined in terms of a 
timeline that shows the states of component agents and channels as time
progresses.

<p>
Consistent cuts of timelines.

<p>
Global snapshots

<p>
Logical clock
