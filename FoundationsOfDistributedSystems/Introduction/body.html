    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Foundations Of Distributed Systems</h2>
    This chapter describes the foundational concepts of distributed
systems.
<p>
The module on agents and channels describes how distributed systems,
    in this course, are specified as directed graph in which vertices
represent agents and edges represent channels.
A computation of a distributed system is defined in terms of a
nondeterministic loop described in the previous chapter.

<p>
The next module on timelines shows how the computation of a
distributed system can be defined in terms of a 
timeline that shows the states of component agents and channels as time
progresses.

<p>
Consistent cuts of timelines.

Global snapshots

<p>
Logical clock
