    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Agents and Shared Variables</h1>

    </p>
    A concurrent system consists of a set of agents and a set
    of shared variables.
    
    The state of the system is given by the states
    of its agents and the values of shared variables.

    An action of the system changes values of a subset of shared
    variables and the state of <i>at most one</i> agent.

    We say that an action \(a\) <i>belongs to</i> agent \(A\) exactly
    when \(a\) changes the state of \(A\). Each action belongs to
    exactly one agent.

    Some actions belonging to an agent may be fair and others unfair.

    </p>

    <p>
    An action \(a\) that belongs to agent \(A\) is specified by Hoare
    triples of the form: \(\{P_{A}\} \; a \; \{Q_{A}\}\), where
    \(P_{A}\) and \(Q_{A}\) are predicates on the states of agent
    \(A\) and shared variables that the action references. The action
    is independent of the states of agents other than \(A\) and is
    also independent of variables that the action does not reference.
    </p>

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Agent Diagram</h3>
    The agents and shared variables of a system are represented by an
    agent diagram which is a directed graph in which a vertex
    represents either an agent or a shared variable.
    An agent is represented by a circle and a shared variable by a
    rectangle. 
    The edges are directed
    either from an agent to a shared variable, or from a shared
    variable to an agent.
    <p>
    An edge from an agent \(A\) to a shared
    variable \(X\) indicates that \(A\) writes \(X\) in at least one
    action of \(A\). Likewise, an edge from a shared variable \(X\) to
    an agent \(B\) indicates that \(B\) reads \(X\) in at least one
    action of \(A\). Therefore, edges in both directions between an
    agent \(C\) and a shared variable \(Y\) indicates that there exists at
    least one action in which \(C\) reads \(Y\) and there exists at
    least one action in which \(C\) writes \(Y\).
    </p>

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Timeline Diagrams</h1>
<!---------------------------------------------------->

<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline">timeline<a> of an
object shows the sequence of events, in chronological order, that occur
to that object.

A timeline can be represented as a straight-line labeled directed graph in
which a vertex represents an event, and the edge from one event to the
next is labeled with the state between the events, and
each vertex is labeled with the identity of the event that the vertex
represents.
</p>

<p>
A system trajectory is a path through the state-transition graph in
which a state is represented by a vertex, and a state transition is
represented by an edge.

By contrast, when a trajectory is represented as a timeline,  a state is
represented by an edge (which is labeled with the state), and a 
state transition is represented by a vertex.

<p>
A state transition is an <i>event</i> in the timeline. Events are
instantaneous. An event belongs to the agent whose action causes the
state transition to occur.

An event changes the state of the agent to which the event
belongs, and does not change the state of any other agent.

An event changes the shared variables that are written during the
event and does not modify any other shared variable.


<p>
The initial event of the timeline is a "dummy" event that merely
starts the timeline.
The very first edge from this dummy event to the first actual event
represents the initial state of the trajectory.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red;">Example</h1>
<p>
The figures below show a state transition graph and a trajectory
through the graph expressed as both a sequence of states and a
sequence of state transitions. We will visit this problem later when
we study mutual exclusion. The details of states and transitions are
not relevant now.
</p>


    <figure>
    <img src="StateTransitionGraph.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:80%">>
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example of a State Transition Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

The system represents a
client that interacts with a server. Muliple clients exchange messages with the server, where
clients and the server are agents. The graph only shows states of a
single client.

<h3 style="color:red;">States in the Example</h3>
The client has three
states:
<ol>
  <li> <i>O:</i> Executing <i>o</i>utside a critical section. </li>
  <li> <i>W:</i> <i>W</i>aiting for a message from the server to enter
  the critical section. </li>
  <li> <i>C:</i> In the <i>c</i>ritical section.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color:red;">State Transitions in the Example</h3>
The client has the following state transitions.

<ol>
  <li> <i>n</i>: <i>n</i>eed a critical section. </li>
  <li> <i>e</i>: <i>e</i>ntering the critical section. </li>
  <li> <i>f</i>:  <i>f</i>inishing critical section.</li>
  <li> <i>a</i>:  <i>a</i>borting critical section.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The next diagram shows a trajectory as a path through the state
transition graph, represented as a linear sequence of states. The
diagram also shows the same trajectory as a timeline: a sequence of
events. The initial dummy event is represented by an asterisk,
(*).
</p>

    <figure>
    <img src="TrajectoryAsTimeline.jpg" alt="Fig3" style="width:80%">>
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Trajectory as Timeline</figcaption>
    </figure>


<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines of Agents and Variables</h1>
As we see in the above example, the timeline of a system can be
represented by a linear graph in which vertices are events, and edges
are labeled with the system states between events. Next, we show the
how to convert such a system timeline \(ST\) to  an equivalent representation
as a labeled directed graph \(G\)
containing a separate timeline for for each agent and for each shared
variable. The timelines of agents and shared variables are represented
by straight lines, usually horizontal, with time increasing from left
to right. 

<h2 style="color:red;">Example
</h2>
In the following example, the system consists of agents \(A, B, C, D\)
and shared variables \(v, w, x\). The system timeline has events \(1,
2, \ldots, 9, 10\). The diagram shows which agents execute which
events, which variables are modified and which are read during each
event. All edges on each horizontal line are directed towards
increasing order of time, i.e., from left to right; the arrows showing
edge directions are not shown so as not to crowd the diagram.

<p>
For example, agent \(A\) executes event \(1\); in this event \(A\) writes and
possibly reads shared variable \(w\), shown by the edge directed from
\(A\)'s timeline to the timeline of shared variable \(w\).
This event changes the states of agent \(A\) and shared variable \(w\), and
leaves the states of all other agents and variables unchanged.

<p>
Here's another example: agent \(B\) executes event \(4\); in this event \(B\) writes and
possibly reads shared variable \(v\), and also reads shared variable \(w\).
This event changes the states of agent \(B\) and shared variable \(v\), and
leaves the states of all other agents and variables unchanged.

<figure>
    <img src="AgentVariableTimeline.jpg" alt="Fig4" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Timeline of Agents and Shared Variables</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Initial States</h3>
<p>
Each agent and variable timeline in \(G\) starts with a dummy event.
The dummy event that starts the timeline, i.e., at the left end of
each timeline, is not shown in the example.  The edge in an agent's
timeline from this initial event is labeled with the initial state of
the agent.  Likewise, the edge in a shared variable's timeline from
this initial event is labeled with the initial value of the variable
in the system timeline \(ST\).


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Vertices in Timelines</h3>

<i>Vertices in Agent Timelines</i>:
An event \(e\) is represented by a vertex in the timeline of the agent
\(A\) to
which \(e\) belongs;  \(e\) does not appear in the timelines of
other agents. An event is labeled with the action that caused the
state transition. In the example diagram, events are numbered in
increasing order of appearance in the system timeline, but events
aren't labeled.
</p>

<i>Vertices in Variable Timelines</i>:
An event \(e\) belonging to agent \(A\) is represented by a vertex in the
timeline of a shared variable \(v\) only if \(A\) writes \(v\) during
the event. If \(A\) reads, but does not write \(v\) during the event, then the event
does not appear in \(v\)'s timeline.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Edges in Timelines</h3>

<i>Edges within Timelines</i> :
There exists an edge from an event \(e\) to an event \(e'\) in an
agent \(A\)'s timeline if and only if \(e'\) is the event that immediately
follows \(e\) in the sequence of events belonging to \(A\) in the
system timeline. The edge is labeled with \(A\)'s state after event
\(e\) and before event \(e'\). These edges are drawn perpendicular to
the agent and variable timelines to indicate that the events are
instantaneous. 

<p>
Similarly, there exists an edge from an event \(e\) to an event \(e'\) in a
variable \(v\)'s timeline if and only if \(e'\) is the event that
immediately follows
\(e\) in the sequence of events that write variable \(v\) in the
system timeline. The edge is labeled with \(v\)'s value after event
\(e\) and before event \(e'\).

<p>
<i>Edges from Agent Timelines to Variable
Timelines</i> : 
There exists an edge from the vertex representing an event \(e\) on an
agent \(A\)'s timeline to the vertex representing <i>the same event</i> \(e\) on a
shared variable \(v\)'s timeline. This edge indicates that \(A\)
writes, and possibly reads, 
\(v\) during event \(e\). The edge is labeled with the value that
\(A\) writes into \(v\).

<p>
<i>Edges from Variable Timelines to Agent
Timelines </i> :
There exists an edge from the vertex representing an event \(e\) on
shared variable \(v\)'s timeline to the vertex representing a different event
\(e'\) on agent \(A\)'s timeline if and only if (1) \(A\) reads, but does
not write, \(v\)
during event \(e'\), and (2) \(e\) is the most recent event prior to \(e'\) that
writes \(v\). The edge is labeled with the value of \(v\) that is read
by \(A\) during the event.


<h2 class="w3-text-teal">System State at an Instant</h2>
The system state at an instant in time is represented by a line
through the timeline diagrams of agents and variables corresponding to
that instant. An point \(T\) in a timeline is represented by a vertical line
corresponding to that point.

<figure>
    <img src="TimelineStateAtInstant.jpg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: System State at an Instant shown on Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In the figure, the green line represents a point \(T\) in the system
timeline. The state of each agent and each shared variable is the
state of the corresponding edge that is cut by the green line. For
example, the state of agent \(C\) at \(T\) is the label of the edge
after event \(5\) and before event \(7\) on \(C\)'s timeline.
</p>

<p>
The edge \(5, 7\) that is cut by the green line tells us that a value
written for variable \(x\) before \(T\) will be read by agent \(C\)
after \(T\).
</p>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Equivalence of System and Graph Timelines</p>
We showed how to determine a graph with a separate timeline for each
agent and shared variable from the system timeline which is a sequence
of state transitions. We can obtain the system timeline from the graph
by determining the system (or "global") state at each point. In
essence, we move the green vertical line from left to right (the initial point to
later points) and determine the system state at each point.








<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Observation: Timeline Diagrams are Acyclic</h2>
All edges in the diagram are directed from earlier times to later times
(i.e. left to right) or are vertical (simultaneous). Vertical edges
are directed from agent timelines to shared variable
timelines. Therefore all paths in the graph have no cycles.


<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Independent Events</h2>
Events \(e\) and \(e'\) on a timeline graph are independent exactly
when there is no path from either event to the other. In the example,
events \(1\) and \(2\) are independent. By contrast 
events \(1\) and \(3\) are dependent because there exists a path from 
\(1\) to \(3\).
</p>

<p>
Events \(1\) and \(2\) are independent because they
are events that belong to different agents \(A\) and \(D\), and agent
\(A\) in event \(1\) does not
modify any variable that is referenced (i.e. read or written) by agent \(D\) in event \(2\); and
likewise, agent \(D\) in event \(2\) does not
modify any variable that is referenced by agent \(A\) in event \(1\).

<p>
Events \(1\) and \(3\) are dependent because agent \(A\) modifies
shared variable \(w\) in event \(1\), and \(w\) is subsequently
referenced by agent \(B\) in event \(3\).
</p>









<h1>OLD STUFF</h1>


<p>
The edges of the graph are \((e_{i}, e_{i+1})\) where \(e_{j}\) is the
vertex representing the \(j\)-th event, for \(0 \leq j\).
The edge \((e_{i}, e_{i+1})\) is labeled with the state of the object
between \(e_{i}\) and \(e_{i+1}\).
</p>

<p>
We adopt the conventions that timelines are horizontal lines and that
time progresses from left to right.
</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">System Trajectories as Timelines</h2>

<p>
A system trajectory is a path through the state-transition graph in
which a state is represented
by a vertex, and a state transition is represented by an edge.

By contrast, in a trajectory represented as a timeline,  a state is
represented by an edge, and a 
state transition is represented by a vertex. 

The initial event \(e_{0}\) of the timeline starts the timeline and
the edge \((e_{0}, e_{1})\) represents the initial state of the
trajectory.
</p>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Interchanging order of adjacent independent events</h4>
<p>
An action is said to <i>reference</i> a shared variable \(v\) when the
action reads or modifies \(v\).

Events \(e\) and \(e'\) are said to be <i>dependent</i> exactly when
(1) both events are at the same agent, or
(2)
either
event modifies a variable that is referenced by the other event. 
</p>

<p>
Consider a pair \(e_{i}, e_{i+1}\) of adjacent independent (i.e., not
dependent) events in \(T\). The variables and agent
state referenced by each agent is unchanged by the other
event. Therefore, the
events can occur in either order.
</p>











<p>
Let \(T'\) be a sequence that is
indentical to \(T\) except that the order in which \(e_{i}\) and
\(e_{i+1}\) is flipped. Then \(T'\) is also a trajectory and the
states before \(e_{i}\) and after \(e_{i+1}\) are identical in \(T\)
and \(T'\).
</p>



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">From System Timeline to Parallel Agent
Timelines</h2>

<p>
Next we associate a graph with a timeline representation of a
trajectory, where the graph has a separate timeline for each agent.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timeline of an Agent</h3>

<p>
The timeline of an agent, during a system trajectory, is the sequence
of events that occur at that agent.  An event at an agent is the
execution of an action by that agent.  An edge in an agent's timeline
is directed from an event at that agent to the next event at that
agent. The edge is labeled with the agent's state between successive
events.
</p>

<p>
The next state of an agent after a state transition depends on the
prior states of the agent and shared variables. Now we show how the
states of shared variables are represented in the graph.
</p>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">System Timeline to Agent Timelines</h3>

<p>
Next we describe the graph \(G\) associated with a timeline
\(T\). 
</p>

<p><i>Vertices of \(G\)</i></p>
<p>
The vertices of \(G\) are exactly the same as those in \(T\).
</p>

<p><i>Edges of \(G\)</i></p>
<p>
\(G\) has an edge \((e, e')\) for dependent events \(e\) and \(e'\)
that occur at agents \(a\) and \(a'\) respectively,
where \(e'\) is the first event that occurs at
\(a'\) in \(T\) after \(e\).
</p>


<p>
Therefore, \(G\) has an edge \((e, e')\) for:
<ol>
  <li>
  successive events \(e\) and \(e'\)
  at the same agent \(a\). These are the edges associated with the timeline
  of \(a\).
  </li>
  <li>
  dependent events \(e\) and \(e'\) that occur at different agents
  \(a\) and \(a'\), respectively, and \(e'\) is the first event that
  occurs at \(a'\) in \(T\) after \(e\).
  </li>
</ol>
</p>



<h4 class="w3-text-teal">System Timelines consistent with Agent Timelines</h4> 
<p>
\(G\) is acylic because every edge is directed from an earlier
event to a later event. The set of vertices of an acyclic graph represents a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">
partially ordered set</a> 
where \(v \leq w\) exactly when \(v
= w\) or there exists an edge \((v, w)\).
</p>

<p>
A total order, consistent with a partial order
\(\leq\), is any sequence in which:  If
\(v < w\) then \(v\) appears before \(w\) in the sequence.
The timeline \(T\) is a total order consistent with
\(\leq\).

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timeline Theorem</h3>
<p>
All total orders consistent with \(\leq\)
are trajectories that start at the initial state of \(T\), and end at
the final state of \(T\).
</p>

<p><i>Proof</i></p>

<p>
Let \(R\) be any total order consistent \(\leq\). We will prove that
\(R\) is a trajectory.

The proof is similar to that of a bubble sort. We give an iteration
that generates a sequence of trajectories, starting with \(T\) and
ending with \(R\).
</p>

<p>
For any total order \(Q\), let \(f(Q)\) be the number of out-of-order
pairs of elements in \(Q\) relative to \(R\). A pair \((v, w)\) is out
of order in \(Q\) with respect to \(R\) if \(v\) appears before \(w\)
in \(R\), and \(v\) appears after \(w\) in \(Q\).
</p>

<p>
\(f\) is bounded below by \(0\), and \(f(Q) = 0\) exactly when \(Q =
R\). We will use \(f\) as a variant function or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant">loop variant</a>
to prove that the iteration terminates.
</p>

<p>
Let \(Q\) be any trajectory consistent with \(\leq\).

If \(Q\) is different from \(R\), then there exists
an adjacent out-of-order pair of elements \((e_{i}, e_{i+1})\) in
\(Q\), i.e., \(e_{i}\) appears immediately before \(e_{i+1}\) in
\(Q\), whereas \(e_{i}\) appears after \(e_{i+1}\) in \(R\).

As we said earlier, the
total order, \(Q'\), obtained by flipping the order of \((e_{i},
e_{i+1})\) in \(Q\) is also a trajectory.

The theorem follows by induction on values of \(f\), since
\(f(Q') < f(Q)\).
</p>







<p class="w3-text-teal">When Shared Variables are Queues</p>
<p>
In many systems, shared variables are queues where exactly one agent
 enqueues messages on the queue and exactly one agent dequeues
 messages from the queue. The receiving agent eventually dequeues
 every message that the sender enqueues. The edges from one agent's
 timeline to another can be labeled with the message sent by the
 sender and eventually received by the receiver.
</p>


    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    A system consists of agents \(a_{i}\)  and shared variables
    \(v_{i}\) for \(i = 0, 1\).
    Let \(f(i) = (i+1) mod 2\); thus \(f(i)\) is the index of the
    agent other than agent \(i\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The agents send indivisible
    tokens to each other. The state of agent \(i\) 
    is a
    non-negative integer \(n_{i}\), which is the number of tokens that agent \(i\)
    holds.
    The shared variable \(v_{i}\) represents a message-passing channel
    from agent \(i\) to agent \(f(i)\).
    The channel contains tokens in transit, and \(v_{i}\) is a nonnegative integer,
    which is the number of tokens in the channel.
    The state of the system is given by \([n_{0}, n_{1}, v_{0},
    v_{1}]\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Agent \(i\) has two actions:
    <ol>
      <li>
      <p>
     <i>send</i>, \(s_{i}\): This action takes a token that the agent \(i\) has and adds it to
    the shared variable \(v_{i}\). This action is specified by the Hoare
    triple: For all \(N, M\):
      </p>
      <p>
      \(
      \{(n_{i} > 0) \wedge (n_{i}, v_{i} = N, M)\} \; s_{i} \;
    \{n_{i}, v_{i} = N-1, M+1\}
      \)
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
     <i>receive</i>,  \(r_{i}\): This action takes a token in
    the shared variable \(v_{f(i)}\), if it is positive, and adds it to
    the agent. The action is specified by the Hoare 
    triple: For all \(N, M\):
      </p>
      <p>
      \(
      \{(v_{f(i)} > 0) \wedge (n_{i}, v_{f(i)} = N, M)\} \; s_{i} \;
    \{n_{i}, v_{f(i)} = N+1, M-1\}
      \)
      </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    Now let's look at the same example but where the shared variables
    are queues rather than integers.
    The operations on a queue are (1)
    <i>enqueue</i> a value and (2) <i>dequeue</i> a nonempty queue.
    The state of a queue is a sequence of values.
    If \(seq\) is the sequence of values before
    the action \(enqueue(m)\)

<h1>LEFT OVER</h1>
    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    The system sorts a vector \(x[0, \ldots, N]\).
    
    The system has a single
    shared variable \(x[M]\) where \(0 < M < N\) and two agents \(L\),
    for left, 
    and \(R\), for right. The local
    variables of agent \(L\) are \(x[0, \ldots, M-1]\), and the local
    variables of agent \(R\) are \(x[M+1, \ldots, N]\).
    The figure below depicts agents and shared variables.
</p>



    <p>
    Agent \(L\) has two actions: (1) it sorts its local variables
    \(x[0, \ldots, M-1]\), and (2) it orders the pair \(x[M-1, M]\).
    Likewise, agent \(R\) has two actions: (1) it sorts its local variables
    \(x[M+1, \ldots, N]\), and (2) it orders the pair \(x[M, M+1]\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The action of each agent is independent of the state of the other
    agent. 
    Each of these actions is executed infinitely often to sort \(x\).
    (This example is included merely to illustrate agents;
    it is an inefficient way of sorting.)
    </p>


    <p style="color:red;">Example: Generalization of Sorting</p>
    A generalization of the previous example is as follows. The system
    has several agents, each of which has a local variable which is a
    segment \(x[i, \ldots, j]\) of \(x\), where \(x[i-1]\) and
    \(x[j+1]\) are shared variables, and where the local and shared
    variables span \(x\). Each agent has actions that sort the local
    variables and that put the pairs, \(x[i-1, i]\) and \(x[j, j+1]\),
in order.
</p>

<p>
The action of each agent is independent of the states of other
agents.
