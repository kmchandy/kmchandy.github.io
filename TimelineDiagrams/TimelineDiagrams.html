<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Timelines: Introduction</h1>
<!---------------------------------------------------->

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h2>
    
    This module describes <i>timelines</i> of systems. A system <i>trajectory</i>
    is represented by a path in a
    state-transition system. A timeline is a representation of the
    trajectory as a sequence of state transitions that evolve over time.
    A <i>timeline diagram</i> is a timeline with a graph showing the
    relationship between state transitions.

    <p>
    This module shows that permuting independent events doesn't change
    the final state of a trajectory.
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem">
    (This is an application of the
    diamond property and the Church-Rosser theorem.</a> You don't need to
    know the theorem to understand this module.)

    <p>
    The module introduces the concept of <i>cuts</i> in timelines and defines
    <i>consistent cuts</i>.

<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Timeline Diagrams</h3>
    <!---------------------------------------------------->
    The state of a system is given by the values of a set of
    variables. A state transition modifies some variables and reads,
    but does not modify, other variables. We assume that a transition
    that modifies a variable also reads that variable.
    <p>
    A trajectory is a sequence of states
    \(s_{0}, s_{1}, \ldots\) where the system has a transition from
    \(s_{i}\) to \(s_{i+1}\), all \(i\).

    We call state transitions <i>events</i>. A path is specified by
    the event sequence \(e_{0}, e_{1}, \ldots\) where
    \(e_{i} = (s_{i}, s_{i+1})\) is the \(i\)-th state transition in
    the path.

    <p>
     A timeline diagram is a labeled directed graph where the vertices
    represent events and  edges represent dependence between events.

    The edges in a timeline diagram are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>There is an edge from an event that modifies a variable
      \(v\) to the next event that modifies \(v\).
      </li>
      <li> For an event \(e_{i}\) in which a variable \(v\) is read, but 
      not modified:
      <ol>
	<li> there is an edge to \(e_{i}\) from the most recent 
	event prior to \(e_{i}\) that modifies \(v\), and
	</li>
	<li> there is an edge from \(e_{i}\) to the next event that
	modifies \(v\).
	</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The label of an edge from an event specifies the
    values of variables referenced in the event immediately after the event.
    <p>
    We adopt
    the convention that time goes from left to right, and timelines
    of variables are horizontal lines.

    <h4 style="color:red;">Example of a Timeline Diagram</h4>
    The system in this example has variables \(W, X, Y, Z\).
    <p>
Initially \(W, X, Y, Z = 0, 0, 0, 0\). A trajectory is caused
    by the following actions:

<ol start="0">
  <li>\(W = W + 1\)
  </li>
  <li>
  \(X = X + W + 1\)
  </li>
  <li>
  \(Y = Y + W + 2\)
  </li>
  </li>
  <li>
  \(Z = Z+ X + Y\)
  </li>
</ol>
</p>


<figure>
    <img src="TimelineDiagrams_Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:75%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: A Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The timeline for each variable is shown as a horizontal red line. The
diagram has four vertices, indexed \(0, 1, 2, 3\), corresponding to
the four events. The diagram has an edge from event \(0\) to event
\(2\) because variable \(W\) is modified in event \(0\) and read in
event \(2\); this edge is labeled \(W = 1\), the value of variable
\(W\) immediately after the event.

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Permuting Adjacent Events in a Trajectory</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</p>
Let \(TD\) be the timeline diagram for a trajectory specified by the
sequence of events \(C = e_{0}, e_{1}, \ldots,
e_{N}\), and let \(TD'\) be the timeline diagram for a trajectory
\(C'\) which is
identical to \(C\) except that the order in which \(e_{i}\) and
\(e_{i+1}\) appear is interchanged. 
<p>
If there is no edge between \(e_{i}\) and
\(e_{i+1}\) in \(TD\) then the graphs, including labels, for \(TD\)
and \(TD'\) are identical.

<p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The proof is straightforward.

<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="TimelineDiagrams_Slide2.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:75%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Timeline Diagram Changing order of Events 1 and 2 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Figure 2 shows the timeline diagram obtained by switching the order in
which events 1 and 2 occur, from left to right, in figure 1. The state
after both events occur is the same in both figures: \(W, X, Y, Z = 1,
2, 3, 0\).

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Permuting Events in a Trajectory</h2>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</p>
Let \(TD\) be the timeline diagram representing a path specified by a
sequence of events 
trajectory \(C = e_{0}, e_{1}, \ldots, e_{N}\). Let \(TD'\) be a timeline
diagram of a path \(C'\) which is a permutation of \(C\) where
\(e_{i}\) appears before \(e_{j}\) in \(C'\) when there is an edge from
\(e_{i}\) to \(e_{j}\) in \(TD\).
<p>
The graphs, including edge labels,
are identical for \(TD\) and \(TD'\). 
<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
Proof follows by repeatedly flipping the order of adjacent
indenpendent elements of \(TD\) until \(TD'\) is obtained.

<h4 style="color:red;">Examples of Event Permutations</h4>
The next two diagrams show timeline diagrams with events permuted
while satisfying the condition of the theorem. The events are the same
as in the previous diagrams, with event 4, \(A = 2*X\) and event 5, \(B
= 2* Y\).

<p>
The theorem tells us the graph and edge labels don't change if we
change the time of events provided no edge goes backwards in time.

    <figcaption>Fig.4: Timeline Diagram After Permuting Events </figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Dependent events</p>
A pair of events are <i>dependent</i> exactly when a variable modified
by one event is referenced in the other.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Corollary</h4>
Let \(C = e_{0}, e{1}, \ldots\) be a trajectory. Let \(C'\) be any
permutation of \(C\) that starts in the same state as \(C\), and where
\(e_{i}\) appears before \(e_{j}\) in
\(C'\) when \(e_{i}\) and \(e_{j}\) are dependent, and \(e_{i}\)
appears before \(e_{j}\) in \(C\).
Then \(C\) and \(C'\) end in the same state.

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Consistent Cuts of Timelines</h2>
A time \(T\) is represented by a vertical line that cuts through the
timelines of all variables.
The system state at \(T\) is given by the variable values where
variable timelines are intercepted by \(T\).

<figure>
    <img src="TimelineDiagrams_Slide5.jpg" alt="Fig5" style="width:75%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: The State at an Instant in a Timeline </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The events in the past at \(T\) are represented by the vertices to the
left of the line \(T\), while the events in the future are to the
right. In figure 5, the events prior to \(T\) are \(0, 2, 5\) and
events after \(T\) are \(1, 3, 4\).

<p>
The state at \(T\) in one timeline diagram is represented by a
curvilinear line in a different timeline diagram with the same events
and graph.
For example, the vertical line representing the state at \(T\) in the
timeline diagram of figure 5 appears as a curved line in the
timeline diagram of figure 6.
<figure>
    <img src="TimelineDiagrams_Slide6.jpg" alt="Fig6" style="width:75%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Time in a Timeline Represented in a Different
Timeline </figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>
The events before \(T\) in the first timeline diagram are \(0, 2, 5\),
and these events appear on one side of the curvilinear line while the
other events, \(1, 3, 4\), appear on the other.

<p>
A <i>cut</i> of a timeline is a set of events. The curvilinear line in
figure 6 is specified by the cut: \(0, 2, 5\).
<!------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Consistent Cut</h3>
A consistent cut is one in which every edge to a vertex in the cut is from
a vertex in the cut.
<p>
Equivalently, a cut is consistent
exactly when every edge from a vertex outside the cut is to a vertex
outside the cut.
<p>
We also use the term "valid cut" for "consistent cut."

<p style="color:red;">Examples of Consistent and Inconsistent Cuts</p>
The cut \(0, 2, 5\) in figure 6 is a consistent cut. We can prove the
consistentity of this cut by showing 
that every edge from \(1, 3, 4\) is to \(1, 3, 4\).
An example of an <i>inconsistent</i> cut is \(0, 1, 5\) because the edge
\((2, 5)\) is from a vertex, \(2\) outside the cut to a vertex, \(5\),
inside the cut.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">System State at a Consistent cut</h3>
The system state at a consistent cut is specified by the values of
variables after events in the cut and before events that are not in
the cut. It is given by the values of variable timelines intersected by
the cut.
<p>
Let's get the state at the consistent cut shown in figure 6. Going along
the cut from bottom to top, the values at the points at which the cut
intersects the variable timelines are: \(B = 6, Y = 3, Z = 0, W = 1, X
= 0, A = 4\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Consistent cuts and Instants in Time</h4>
We will show that each curvilinear consistent cut in a timeline diagram of a trajectory
corresponds to a point in time --- a vertical straight-line cut --- in
the timeline diagram of another trajectory.

<p>Pictorially, we pull the curvlinear consistent cut taut to
make it vertical. Doing so pushes events outside the cut to the right
of the vertical line, and pushes events in the cut to the left of the
line while <i>retaining the property that all edges
are directed from the past to the future,</i> i.e. from left to
right. When the cut is a vertical line it represents an instant in
time but in a different timeline diagram.

<p style="color:red;">Example of Straightening a Curvilinear Consistent
Cut</p>
The figure below shows a curvilinear consistent cut. Think of the cut as a
string and tauten it to make it vertical. Doing so pushes events \(2\)
and \(5\) to the left, and events \(1\)
and \(4\) to the right, while ensuring that all edges are directed
from left to right. When the cut is vertical we get the diagram shown
in figure 5.

<figure>

    <figcaption>Fig.7: Straightening a Curvilinear Consistent Cut</figcaption> 
</figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h4>
This module introduced timeline diagrams; showed that permuting independent
events doesn't change the final state;  and defined consistent cuts and states at
consistent cuts.
