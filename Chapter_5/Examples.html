<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Examples of the Proof Pattern</h1>
This module has three examples of the proof pattern described in this
    chapter. Keep in mind that there are different types of patterns
    of problems and proofs; this module has examples of only one of
    them. 

<!------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Example 1: Average of Sensor Readings</h2>
    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
    A system has \(N\) sensors. The connectivity between sensors is
    represented by an undirected graph which has a vertex for each
    sensor, and where an undirected edge \(\{i, j\}\) indicates that
    sensors \(i\) and \(j\) can communicate. Associated with sensor
    \(i\) is a value \(D_{i}\) which (for the purposes of this
    example) is a constant integer. Sensor \(i\) has a variable
    \(t_{i}\) which takes on integer values and is initially equal to
    \(D_{i}\). The informal goal of the algorithm is to make all elements of
    \(t\) close to the mean of the elements of \(D\) subject to the
    requirement that \(t\) is integer. We define two predicates,
    \(S\), \(Q\) as follows:

    <p>
    \(
    S = (\sum_{i} t_{i} = \sum_{i} D_{i})
    \)
    </p>

    <p>
    \(
    Q = (\forall \; \textrm{edges} \; (i, j): |t_{i} - t_{j}| \leq 1)
    \)
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(S\) holds then the average over elements of \(t\) is the
    average over elements of \(D\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Because \(t\) takes on integer values and when the average has a
    fraction, we cannot demand that all elements of \(t\) are equal to
    the average.  Predicate \(Q\) says that neighboring values of
    \(t\) are as close as possible while remaining integers.
    <p>

    <p>
    The specification is:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(
    (t = D) \; \leadsto \; (S \wedge Q)
    \)
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm</h3>
    Associated with every unordered pair \(\{i, j\}\) is an
    action \(a_{i,j}\) which is executed infinitely often and where
    the action is specified by the following Hoare triple:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(
    \{t = T\} \; a_{i,j} \; \{S' \wedge R\}
    \)
    </p>
    <p>
    where \(S' = (\sum_{i} t_{i} = \sum_{i} T_{i})\), and
    \(R\) is:

    <p>
    \(
    (|T_{i} - T_{j}| \leq 1 \; \Rightarrow (t = T)) \; \wedge\)
    <br>
    \(
    (|T_{i} - T_{j}| > 1 \; \Rightarrow (|t_{i} - t_{j}| < |T_{i} - T_{j}|))
    \)
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the sum of elements of \(t\) remain unchanged by each
    action, it follows that this sum is the same as the sum of
    elements of \(D\).
    </p>

    <p>
    From \(R\) it follows that action \(a_{i,j}\) leaves a state
    unchanged if the absolute difference between \(t_{i}\) and
    \(t_{j}\) in that state is 0 or 1. Otherwise, the action moves
\(t_{i}\) and \(t_{j}\) closer to each other.
</p>

    <p>
    For example, if \(T_{i} = 0\) and \(T_{j} = 5\) then possible
    values for the ordered pair \((t_{i}, t_{j})\) after the action
    are: \((1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)\).
    </p>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
Next, we carry out the steps of the proof pattern.

 
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal"> Step 1: Prove that every state change takes
the system towards the goal.</h4>

<p>
    \(
    safe = S
    \)
</p>
<p>
    \(
    f(t) = \sum_{i} t_{i}^{2}
    \)
</p>


<p>
From the Hoare triple for actions \(a_{i,j}\), every state transition
is back to the same state or reduces the variant function.
</p>

<p>
The proof obligation in this step can be simplified to:
</p>

<p>
\(
(M < t \leq D) \wedge (t = T) \; \rightarrow \;
 (M \leq t \leq T)
\)
</p>
<p>
which follows directly from the Hoare triples for all the actions.
</p>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Step 2: Atomic Properties</h3>
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Prove that the system leaves non-goal states.</h4>

<p>
The proof obligation in the second step simplifies to:
<p>
\(
(M < t \leq D) \wedge (t = T) \; \leadsto \; ( t \neq T)
\)
</p>

<p>
The proof is as follows. From the atomic property, since action
\(a_{i,j}\) is executed infinitely often:
<p>
\(
(M < t \leq D) \wedge (t = T) \wedge (t[i] < t[j]) \; \leadsto \; ( t \neq T)
\)
</p>

<p>
The result follows by taking the disjunction of the left-hand sides
over all \(i, j\), and using \(M < t \Rightarrow (\exists i, j: t[i] <
t[j])\).
</p>

<p> Applying the basic property and transitivity with the variant
function proves \(t = D \; \leadsto \; t = M\). The proof that \(t=M\)
is stable follows directly from the Hoare logic for all actions
\(a_{i,j}\). 
</p>





<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Example 2: Mobile Agents in Formation</h2>
\(N+1\) agents indexed \(0 \leq i \leq N\) are located in 3-D space. Agents \(0\) and
\(N\) remain stationary. Let \(v_{i} = [x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}]\) be the location
of agent \(i\). Each agent \(i\) other than \(0\) and \(N\) can access the
locations, \(v[i-1]\) and \(v[i+1]\), of its neighboring agents, and
can move. The goal of the algorithm is for agents to move so that they
form a straight line, with each agent halfway between its
neighbors. Let \(D[i,j]\) be the distance between agents \(i\) and
\(j\).
</p>

<p>
\(
D[i, j] = || v[i] - v[j] ||\).
</p>

<p>
The goal is to get to a straight-line formation in which agents
are placed equidistant from their neighbors.
The state of the system is given by \(v\), the locations of all agents.
</p>

<p>
Consider neighboring
agents, \(i-1, i, i+1\). A measure of how far agent \(i\) is from the
midpoint of the line joining agents \(i - 1\) and \(i + 1\) is
\(e[i]\) where
</p>

<p>
\(
e[i] = (D[i-1, i] - m)^{2} + (D[i+1, i] - m)^{2}
\)
</p>

where \(m\) is the distance from the midpoint of \(i - 1\) and \(i +
1\) to either agent.

<p>
\(
m = D[i-1, i+1]/2
\)
</p>


A measure \(E\) of the error of a given formation is \(E = \sum_{i}
e[i]\).  Because space is continuous, we weaken the goal from \(E = 0\) to \(E <
N \times \epsilon\) where \(\epsilon\) is a positive
constant. 
</p>

<p>
\(
goal = (E < N \times \epsilon)
\)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the goal is satisfied if
\(e[i] < \epsilon\), for all \(i\).
The specification for this algorithm is that the goal is reached
eventually, regardless of the initial state.
</p>

<p>
\(
True \; \leadsto \; goal
\)
</p>



<!------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm</h3>

<p>
Let \(a_{i}\) be the action taken by agent \(i\).
If agent \(i\) is close enough to both its neighbors, i.e., \(|D[i-1, i] -
D[i, i+1]| < \epsilon\)
then the agent does not move.
Otherwise the agent moves to the midpoint of the line joining its two
neighbors. The action of agent \(i\) can be specified by the program segment:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
<code>
m = (D[i-1, i+1]/2)
if (D[i-1, i] - m)**2 + (D[i, i+1] - m)**2 > epsilon):
    v[i] = (v[i-1] + v[i+1])/2.0
</code>
</pre>
</p>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Step 1</p>

<p>
\(safe\) is True. Any positions of agents is a safe state.
</p>

<p>
The variant function \(f\) is based on the eror \(E\); however, since \(E\) is
continuous, we cannot carry out induction on its values. So, we
discretize the error. Let \(f_{i}\) be the floor of \(e_{i}/\epsilon\):
</p>
\(
f_{i} = \left \lfloor e_{i}/\epsilon
\right \rfloor
\)
<p>
Then if \(f_{i} = n + x\) where \(n\) is a
nonnegative integer and \(0 \leq x < 1\), then \(f_{i} = n\).
Define \(f\) as \(f = \sum_{i} f_{i}\). 
We can carry
out induction on the values of \(f\) because the values are integer
and are bounded below by \(0\).
</p>

<p>
Using Hoare triples for each action, it is straightforward to prove
that every state transition is either (1) back to the same state or (2) to a
goal state or (3) to a state that reduces the value of \(f\).
</p>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Step 2</p>
Because action \(a_{i}\) is executed infinitely often: 
</p>

<p>
\(
(v = V) \wedge (f_{i} > 0) \; \leadsto \; (v \neq V)
\)
</p>

<p>
Taking the disjunction of the left-hand sides and simplifying gives
the desired result:
</p>

<p>
\(
(v = V) \wedge (\neg goal) \; \leadsto \; (v \neq V)
\)
</p>

<p>
The proof of the algorithm now follows by applying steps 3 and 4.
</p>




<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Example 3: Asynchronous Shortest Path</h2>
\(W\), \(D\), and \(d\) are \(N \times N\) matrices where:
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Edge-weight matrix</i> The elements of \(W\) are nonnegative integers,
and \(W[i, i] = 0\) for all \(i\).  \(W[i,j]\) is the weight of the edge from
  vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\).
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Lengths of shortest-paths matrix</i>
  \(D[i,j]\) is the length of the shortest path from
  vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\).
  </li>
  <li>
  \(x\) is a matrix of variables. The state of the system is given by
  \(x\). 
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The specification of the problem is:
</p>

<p>
\(
(x = W) \; \leadsto \; (x = D)
\)
</p>


<!------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm</h3>
Using patterns from the previous examples, we suggest the following
properties.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Safety:</i> \(x\) doesn't increase.
  </p>

  <p>
  For all constant matrices \(X\)
  </p>

  <p>
  \(
  ((W \leq x \leq D) \wedge (x = X))
  \; \rightarrow \;
  (W \leq x \leq X)
  \) 
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Progress:</i> \(x\) changes if it doesn't satisfy the goal.
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  ((W \leq x < D) \wedge (x = X))
  \; \leadsto \;
  (x \neq X)
  \)
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  <i>Variant function</i> is a matrix of integers bounded below by the zero
  matrix. 
  \(
  f(x) = (x - D)
  \)
  </p>
  </li>
  
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The proof of an algorithm that satisfies this safety and progress
property follows directly from steps 1 and 2 of the proof pattern.
We can now specify collections of algorithms that satisfy these
properties.
</p>

<p>Any action that does not increase \(x\) satisfies the safety
criterion. Let's turn our attention to progress.
</p>

<p>
If \(x < D\) then there exists vertices \(i, j, k\) such that:
</p>
<p>
\(
x[i,k] > x[i,j] + x[j,k]
\)
</p>
<p>
So, we require that for every \(i, j, k\)
there exists an action \(a\) that is executed infinitely often, that
changes \(x[i,k]\) if \(x[i,k] > x[i,j] + x[j,k]\), and therefore
satisfies the Hoare triple:
</p>

<p>
\(
\{(x[i,k] > x[i,j] + x[j,k]) \wedge (x = X)\} \; a \; \{x \neq X\} 
\)
</p>

<p>
There are many ways that we can construct algorithms that have these properties.
For example, we
could have an algorithm with an action for every \(i, j, k\)
that sets:
</p>

<p>
\(
x[i,k] = min(x[i,j] + x[j,k] 
\)
</p>

<p>
Or we could have an algorithm in which each action
computes the lengths of shortest paths for a subgraph.
For each \(i, j, k\), the algorithm must have an action, which is
executed infinitely often, and whose subgraph spans \(i, j, k\).
