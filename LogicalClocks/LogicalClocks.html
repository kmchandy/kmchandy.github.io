<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Logical Clocks</h1>
A logical clock algorithm is one in which each agent assigns a
number \(t(e)\), called
a timestamp, to each event \(e\) in its trajectory.
The timestamp of an event
called the value of the logical clock, or the logical time, at the event.
The specification of the algorithm is as follows.

<p>
For all
\(t\), with <i>past</i> events defined as events with timestamps of \(t\) or
less, and <i>future</i> events as those with timestamps greater than
\(t\), the cut \([past, future]\) must be a consistent cut.


<figure>
    <img src="../ChannelSnapshots/Timelines/Timelines.011.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 1: Consistent Cut based on Timestamps</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From the specification it follows that for all edges \((e, e')\) in
the timeline diagram:
\(t(e') > t(e)\).
The algorithm follows directly from this requirement.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm</h4>
<i>Timestamps of messages</i>: An agent assigns a timestamp of
\(t(e)\) to all messages that it sends in event \(e\).


<p>
The timestamp of an initial event is arbitrary.
For any event \(e'\) on an agent, let \(e\) be the event
that immediately precedes \(e\) on that agent.
For an internal event \(e'\) (i.e. an event in which no message is
received), set \(t(e')\) to any value such that
\(t(e') > t(e)\). 
For an event \(e'\) in which 
message with timestamp \(T\) is received, set \(t(e')\) to any value such that
\(t(e') > \textrm{max}(t(e), T)\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Using Logical Clocks to Determine Global
Snapshots</h4>
The state of an agent is its state between past and future. Likewise,
the state of a channel is the sequence of messages sent in the past
and received in the future. So, the global snapshot for any \(T\) can
be obtained in the following way:
<p>
each agent records its
state after an event with timestamp at most \(T\) and before an event
with timestamp greater than \(T\). An agent records the state of an
incoming channel as the sequence of messages that it receives on its
events with timestamps greater than \(T\) where the messages have
timestamps at most \(T\).

<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
The figure shows the global snapshot in which <i>past</i> events are those with
snapshots at most 2. The state of agent \(A\), is its state after its
event with timestamp 1 and before 
its event with timestamp 3.
The state of agent \(B\) is its state after its event with timestamp 2 and before
its event with timestamp 4.

<p>
Agent \(A\) records the state of its incoming channel from \(B\) as
the sequence of messages with timestamps at most 2 that it receives in
its events with timestamps greater than 2. \(A\) stops recording the
state of this channel when it receives a message on the channel with
timestamp greater than 2. The diagram doesn't have any message from
\(B\) to \(A\) with timestamp greater than 2; so, in this diagram
\(A\) is continuing to record the state of this channel at the end of
this trajectory.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Logical Time and Causality</h4>
Lamport proposed logical clocks originally so that if an event \(e\)
could have an impact on an event \(e'\) --- if there is a path from
\(e\) to \(e'\) in the timeline diagram --- then \(t(e') > t(e)\). We
will use logical time for its relevance to timeline diagrams,
causality and global snapshots.
