    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Models of Distributed Systems</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
This page introduces models of distributed systems that we use in
these notes. A model is an abstraction that is helpful in designing
algorithms.

<p>
A distributed system consists of a set of agents and a set of
message-passing channels.  Each channel has a name and is directed
from one agent to one agent.  A system is represented by a labeled
directed graph in which vertices represent agents and labeled directed
edges represent named channels.


<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
The figure below shows a distributed system with agents A, B, C.

    <figure>
    <img src="Fig_1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:50%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Graph Representation of a Distributed Systems</figcaption>
  </figure>
  An edge labeled \(z\) directed from a vertex \(A\) to
    a vertex \(B\)
represents a channel named \(z\) directed from agent \(A\) to agent \(B\).

A channel  \(z\) from an agent \(A\) to an agent \(B\) is called an
<i>outgoing</i> channel of \(A\) and an <i>incoming</i> channel of
  \(B\);
  only \(A\) can send messages and only \(B\) can receive messages
  along this channel.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Agents</h4>
  Each agent has a set of variables that are <i>local</i> to the agent;
other agents and channels cannot access these variables.
The state of an agent is given by the values of its variables.
<p>
An agent may have a local clock; however, clocks are not
  synchronized across agents. At a point in a trajectory, a clock in
  one agent may be ahead, identical to, or behind the clock of another
  agent. 
  We will discuss clock synchronization later.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Channels</h4>
  We will look at systems with different types of channels.
  Let's begin with a model of first-in-first-out (FIFO) channels. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">State of a FIFO Channel</p>
The state of a FIFO channel is a sequence of messages; these are
the messages that have been sent along
that channel and that have not been received.
The only way in which the sequence of messages in a channel can be
altered is that the agent sending messages along the channel can
append messages to the tail of the sequence, 
and a message can be removed from the head of the sequence and
delivered to the agent receiving messages along the channel.

<p>
Unless stated otherwise, the initial state of a channel is the empty
sequence. Then the \(n\)-th message received on a channel is the 
\(n\)-th message sent on that channel, for all \(n\). Furthermore, the 
\(n\)-th message is received on a channel only after the
\(n\)-th message is sent on that channel.



<h4 class="w3-text-teal">State Transitions</h4>
The state of a system is given by the states of its agents and
channels.
A system can change state in two ways: (1) A message is delivered from
a channel to an agent, or (2) an agent changes state without receiving
messages. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">State Transition due to Message Delivery</p>
When a message at the head of a nonempty channel is delivered the
receiver's state may change, and the receiver may send messages on its
outgoing channels. The states of all agents, other than the receiver,
remain unchanged in the transition.  Likewise, the states of all
channels other than channel on which the message is delivered and the
receivers's outgoing channels remain unchanged in the transition.

<p>
The receiver's state after the transition and
the messages that the receiver sends in the transition depend only on
(1) the message that is received in the transition, (2) the channel along
which the message is received, and (3) the receiver's state before the
transition.

<p>
The state transition is specified by the identity \(A\) of the agent that
changes state, the states \(s\) and \(s'\) of the agent before and after the event, the
channel \(c\) on which the message is delivered, the 
message \(m\) delivered, and the messages (if any) sent on each
outgoing channel of the agent. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">State Transition without Message Delivery</p>
This state transition changes the state of <i>one</i> agent and may send
messages on that agent's outgoing channels.
The next state of the agent and the
messages sent depend only on the agent's state before the transition.

<p>
The state transition is specified by the identity \(A\) of the agent that
changes state, the states \(s\) and \(s'\) of the agent before and
after the event, and the messages (if any) sent on each
outgoing channel of the agent.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Locality</h4>
A state transition changes the state of one agent and messages may be sent on that agent's
outgoing channels and one of the agent's incoming channels.
The transition leaves the states of all other agents and channels
unchanged.
State transitions are local to <i>one</i> agent and its incident channels.
We call a transition that changes the state of an agent
\(A\) <i>an event at \(A\)</i>.





<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
Consider a system state \(S\) of the system shown in Fig 1 in which
all channels other than \(x\) and \(y\) are empty.  There are multiple
transitions from \(S\) to other states because transitions can occur
due to the delivery of the message at the head of channel \(x\), or
channel \(y\), or because an agent changes state without receiving
messages.

<p>
Next, consider state transitions when the message in \(x\) is delivered.
Let \(S'\) be the system state
after a transition from \(S\) due to the delivery of a message in
channel \(x\).
The states of agents \(A, C\) are the same in \(S\) and \(S'\), while
the state of \(B\) may be different in \(S\) and \(S'\).

<p>
The states of channels \(u, v, t, z\) are the same in \(S\) and
\(S'\).  The state of channel \(x\) in \(S'\) is the same as its state
in \(S\) except that the head element is deleted.  The states of
channel \(y\) and \(r\) in \(S'\) consists of messages appended to
their corresponding states in \(S\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">System: States and Transitions</h4>
A system is a set of initial states and a set of state transitions.
Each state transition is an event. An
<i>execution</i> is a sequence of states, starting in an
initial state, where there exists a transition from each state in the
sequence to the next state in the sequence.

 
<p>
We also use the terms <i>trajectory</i> and <i>computation</i> for an
execution. 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Different Types of Channels</h4>
Most of the algorithms in these notes use FIFO channels; however, we
also describe algorithms that use other types of channels. Models for
a couple of them are described next.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Out of order messages</p>
Messages may be delivered out of order in some types of channels,
though each message is delivered once. We represent the state of such
a channel as a bag or multiset. A message is sent by adding the
message to the bag and a message is delivered by removing the message
from the bag.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Lossy, multiple delivery channels</p>
In some channels the same message may be delivered repeatedly, and a
message sent later may be received before a message sent earlier.  We
represent the state of such a channel by a set.  A message is sent by
adding it to the set, and a message is delivered by delivering a copy
of any element in the set without modifying the set.
