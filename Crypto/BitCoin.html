<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction to Bitcoin</h1>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module introduces the algorithm underlying BitCoin.
</h4>

    Bitcoin is based on cryptography and distributed consensus. We
    discussed aspects of cryptography required for Bitcoin in an
    <a
    href="./CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">
    earlier module.</a> Next, we study the distributed consensus
    algorithm used by BitCoin.
    
    <a href="https://www.lopp.net/pdf/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf">
    This Princeton University book
    has a superb (and longer) description of consensus in Bitcoin.</a>
    
    <p>
    We discussed distributed consensus in the modules on
    <a href="../Paxos/Paxos.html">Paxos</a> and
    <a href="../Byzantine/ByzantineOral.html">Byzantine Generals with
    written</a> and
    <a href="../Byzantine/ByzantineWritten.html">oral messages.</a>
    The specification of consensus is weaker in
    Bitcoin and the algorithm used to obtain consensus is different
    from those used in Paxos and Byzantine Generals written and oral
    algorithms. The Byzantine Generals algorithms assumes that the
    algorithm operates in rounds, whereas the Bitcoin algorithm
    doesn't require synchronous rounds in which all agents
    participate. The Paxos algorithm does not guarantee progress
    whereas Bitcoin requires progress with high
    probability; you wouldn't want to use coins if you had to wait
    a long time to buy anything.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">No trusted agent</h3>
    In an earlier module we described an algorithm that had many of
    the features that we expect from a
    cryptocurrency. That algorithm had, however, a
    characteristic which is problematic to some: It relies on a
trusted agent.
The trusted agent could be the
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> in the
US or a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">
central bank </a> that manages a currency.
Two of many reasons given for mistrusting banks are that (1) people may
    want to execute transactions in secret giving only their public
    keys, and (2) central banks may be able to print money whereas
    some cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, limit the total amount of
    coins that can ever exist.
    The Bitcoin algorithm is a modification that eliminates the
    trusted agent from the algorithm given in the previous module.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">No assumptions about numbers of agents</h3>
    The Byzantine Generals algorithm uses an upper bound on the number
    of faulty agents. Paxos assumes that the total number of agents is known. 
    The Bitcoin algorithm makes no assumptions about numbers of faulty and
    non-faulty agents other than that there are a large number of agents.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Incentives and transaction fees</h3>
When a currency is managed by a single trusted agent, such as a
bank, we assume that the bank gets some reward for its
service or is paid by a government to carry out this service.
The Bitcoin algorithm pays agents with Bitcoins for checking the validity of
transactions. This payment consists of new coins that are
"mined". More about mining later


<h2 class="w3-text-teal">A First Proposal for an Algorithm</h2>
How can we modify the algorithm we described earlier so that it works
without a trusted agent? 
Let's try this modification:
Select random agents to play the role of the trusted manager.

<p>
A step of the algorithm is as follows:
A single agent is
chosen randomly to play the role of the trusted manager. This agent
receives and validates transactions, gathers some of the transactions
into a block, appends the block to the block chain, and
broadcasts the updated block chain. The
other agents update their copies of the block chain when they receive this
value. The system waits for all agents to update their copies and then
executes the next step.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Challenges of the Proposed Algorithm</h4>
This algorithm has several challenges.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Selecting a single agent.</i>
  How can the collection of agents select a <i>single</i> agent to add
  a block to the block chain? The selection of a single agent requires
  all agents to reach a consensus about which agent to 
  select. So solving the problem this way would require solving
  another consensus problem. The Bitcoin algorithm does
  not select a unique agent to add a block to the block chain;
  however, it uses an ingenious mechanism to ensure that multiple agents
  don't attempt to add blocks at about the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Synchronization</i>:
  How can the collection of agents wait long enough to ensure that all
  agents have updated their copies of the ledger to the most recent version before
  the ledger is modified again?
  <p>
  Consider the following example scenario.  All agents have the same
  copy x of the ledger at some point t. Agent B, selected randomly to
  act as the trusted agent, appends transaction y to the ledger at a
  later point t' at which point B's copy is [x, y].  Then, agent C,
  selected randomly to act as the trusted agent, appends transaction z
  to the ledger at a later point t''. If C's copy is still [x],
  because it has not as yet been updated to [x, y], then after C
  appends z to the ledger, C's copy becomes [x, z].

  <hr class="new2">
    <h5 style="color:blue;">
  A key property of the algorithm with the trusted agent is that two
  copies of the ledger are either identical or the longer copy
  consists of additional transactions appended to the
  shorter copy.
  </h5>
  <hr class="new2">
   With this property, two copies of the ledger are
  either identical or the shorter copy can eventually "catch up" to the longer copy by
  merely by appending more values.

  <p>
  In the example, B may receive
  information about transaction z after receiving information about
  transaction y, whereas C may receive this information in the reverse
  order, which leaves B's copy as [x, y, z] and C's copy as [x, z,
  y]. In this case, the copies remain different forever.
  <p>
  The Bitcoin algorithm <i>does not guarantee synchronization</i>; however,
  its mechanism helps to make many agents append blocks in the same
  order. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Incentives</i>: 
  Why should an agent chosen to play the role of trusted agent agree
  to play that role? What's the incentive? Why wouldn't the trusted
  agent do nothing at all execute its step slowly?
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Untrustworthy Agents</i>:
  The randomly-chosen trusted manager may not be trustworthy. You can
  imagine what may go wrong in the previous algorithm if the bank was
  dishonest.
  </li>
</ol>
Next, let's look at how the Bitcoin algorithm addresses challenges 1
and 2. We'll look at challenges 3 and 4 later.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Selecting a Single Random Agent</h3>
How can an arbitrary set of agents, some of whom may be
malicious, and where the size of the set is unknown, pick a random
agent?


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Using Puzzles to Select a Single Agent</h4>
Let's look at a simple situation:
several people solve puzzles in the same room. When a
person solves her puzzle, she yells "I won!". When a
person hears that somebody else has won she stops solving her puzzle.

<p>
If everybody starts at the same instant and take the same time
then there will be collisions --- many will claim to win at the same time.
If, however, the time to solve
a puzzle is a random variable with a flat distribution then collisions
are unlikely. Bitcoin uses the <i>puzzle-friendly property</i> of cryptographic hash
functions discussed in the
<a href="./Crypto/CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">previous module</a>.

<p>
Now, instead of people being all in the same room, assume that they
are competing across a network. When a person solves a puzzle,
she broadcasts a "I won" message. When a person working on a puzzle
gets a "I won" message from somebody else, she stops working on her
puzzle.

<p>
Collisions are likely if the expected time to solve the puzzle
is small (say a millisecond) compared with the expected time (say a
minute) for a message broadcast by one person to reach others. Message
delays may cause multiple people to solve their puzzles before
receiving "I won" messages.
Collisions are unlikely when times to solve puzzles are much greater
than message delays.

<p>
We could attempt to use timestamps: When a person solves her puzzle
she broadcasts a "I won" message and the time at which she finished
solving the puzzle. If a person gets a "I won" message with an earlier
timestamp then she concedes. This approach is problematic because a
devious agent may not solve the puzzle, or may set her timestamp to an
earlier value.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal"> Puzzles in Bitcoin</h4>
Next let's look at the puzzles used in Bitcoin.
Each agent has its own copy of the block chain.
An agent \(A\) collects a set \(trans\) of transactions that haven't as yet been added
to \(A\)'s copy of the block chain.
Agent \(A\) proposes
to append a block to the chain where the block
consists
of the set \(trans\) in the
following way.

<p>
Let \(ptr\) be the pointer to agent \(A\)'s copy of the block chain. 
Agent \(A\) can add a block containing \(trans\) to the chain only if it
proves that it has solved the following problem --- the "puzzle."

<p>
Find a number, called \(nonce\), such that:
<p>
\(H(nonce + ptr + trans) < target \)
<p>
where \(+\) is the concatenation operator , and <i>target</i> is a
given value.

<p>
For the time being
assume that target is a constant; later, we'll see that it decreases very
slowly over time.
The smaller the value of <i>target</i> the
greater the expected time to solve the puzzle.


<p>
The time to solve a <a
href="./CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">Bitcoin puzzle</a> is a
random variable with a flat distribution. Each proposer 
of a block is probably solving a different puzzle because the block of
transactions that it is aggregating is likely to be different from
that of other proposers. Agents have different amounts of
computing capacity, and the time to solve a puzzle decreases with
capacity.
Agents are unlikely to start solving their puzzles
at the same instant. For these reasons, it is possible, but unlikely, that many agents
will solve their puzzles at the same time.



<p>
Using puzzles to identify a single random agent leaves us with at least three challenges: (1) Collisions
will occur; (2) agents may be devious --- they may claim to have
solved puzzles when they haven't; and (3) agents with computing power
that far exceeds those of others will solve their puzzles faster than
others do --- and so though agents are selected randomly, those with
large computing power are likely to be selected more often.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Attempts at Synchronization</h3>
When an agent \(A\) appends a new block \(B\) to a block chain \(L\) it broadcasts
the new chain \(L + B\). This is analogous to a person shouting "I won" in the
example given earlier.

<p>
When a (non-devious) agent \(A'\), which proposes to extend chain
\(L\), gets a message saying that \(L\) has already been extended to
\(L + B\) then \(A'\)
stops attempting to append a block to \(L\).
Instead, \(A\) starts again with a
new set of transactions that it proposes to append to the
extended chain \(L + B\).

<p>
If the message delay between agents \(A\) and \(A'\) is small compared
to the time to solve puzzles, then a collision
between \(A\) and \(A'\) is unlikely, but still possible. So, it is
possible that \(A\) broadcasts \(L + B\) while \(A'\) broadcasts
\(L + B'\) at about the same time. So different agents may have
different copies of the block chain.
What is the equivalent of the "true" system-wide
block chain when different agents have different copies?

<p>
The Bitcoin algorithm does not use synchrony to deal with this
issue. The problem of different copies of the block chain 
extant at the same time is handled in an ingenious asynchronous way that we
describe later.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Managing Concurrent Updates</h3>

A key step of the Bitcoin algorithm that updates local copies of block
chains is as follows. After an agent creates a block and appends the
newly created block to its local copy it broadcasts its copy of
the block chain.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
When an agent \(A\) gets a message containing a copy
of another agent's block chain, agent \(A\) sets its local copy to the
block chain in the message <i>if and only if</i> the length of the
block chain in the message exceeds the length of \(A\)'s local copy.
</h5>
<hr class="new2">


<p>
Let's look at a scenario.
For this scenario, \(X\) and \(Y\) are single blocks.
Assume that agent \(A\)'s copy of the block chain
is \(L\) when \(A\) receives a message containing the block chain \(L
+ X\). Because the length of the block chain \(L + X\) is bigger than \(A\)'s
copy, \(A\) sets its copy to \(L + X\).

<p>
Now suppose agent \(A\) gets a
message containing the block chain \(L + Y\); what does \(A\) do?
Agent \(A\) ignores the message because the length of \(L + Y\) does not exceed
that of \(A\)'s current copy, \(L + X\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Continuing Collisions</h4>
Let's continue the above scenario.
Can block \(Y\) become part of \(A\)'s
chain, or will it remain forever an "orphan" block
as far as \(A\) is concerned?

<p>
Here's a possible scenario.
An agent with a block
chain copy \(L + 
X\), solves its puzzle and appends a block \(X_{1}\) to get a new copy
\(L + X + X_{1}\) of the block chain which the agent broadcasts.
At the same time, another agent with a block
chain copy \(L + 
Y\), solves its puzzle and appends a block \(Y_{1}\) to get a new copy
\(L + Y + Y_{1}\) which is broadcast.
If \(A\) receives \(L + Y + Y_{1}\) before receiving \(L + X + X_{1}\)
then \(A\) will set its chain to \(L + Y + Y_{1}\), and then reject
\(L + X + X_{1}\).

<p>
You can construct a scenario with a sequence of collisions between
agents appending blocks \(X_{i}\) and other agents appending blocks
\(Y_{j}\) so that \(A\)'s chain switches back and forth between \(X\)
and \(Y\) values.

<p>
Long sequences of collisions are unlikely, and the longer the sequence
the less the probability of continuing collisions.

<p>
So how can an agent determine whether a block is in the chain? And so
how can an agent find out if a transaction has been executed? You
sell your used bicycle to somebody for coins, but how do you know if
that transaction becomes part of <i>the</i> block chain when different
agents have different copies? And so how do you know that you can
spend those coins that
you should have received for your bicycle?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Confidence that a Block is in the Chain</h4>
In this section we discuss the behavior of non-devious agents; we will
show how the algorithm handles devious agents later.

Suppose an agent's copy of the block chain is \(X + X_{1} + X_{2}
+ \ldots + X_{K}\), and another agent's copy is \(Y + ? + ? +
\ldots\), where \(?\) represents arbitrary values. What is the
likelihood that \(Y \neq X\)?

<p>
\(Y\) can be different from \(X\) only if there are a sequence of
\(K\) or more collisions. And the likelihood of a sequence of
collisions decreases with \(K\). Likewise, the likelihood that an
agent never receives a block chain containing \(X\) decreases with
time, and so decreases with \(K\). So, if \(K\) is large then with
very high probability, \(X\) is part of every agent's block chain.


<p>
Now suppose an agent's copy of the block chain is \(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2}
+ \ldots + X_{K}\). What is the likelihood
that another agent's copy is \(L + Y + ? + \ldots\) where \(L\) is an
arbitrary sequence? By the same
argument, when if \(K\) is large then with
very high probability, \(X\) is part of every block chain.

<p>
For practical purposes,
many agents assume that if \(K > 6\) then \(L + X\) is a prefix of
most agents' block chains.
<a href="https://www.lopp.net/pdf/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf
">See the Princeton Bitcoin book.</a>

<p>
Suppose agent \(A\) gets \(N\) Bitcoins in transaction \(X\). If \(K =
0\) then an agent can't be confident that \(A\) ever received these coins
because this transaction may not persist in the block chain. As \(K\)
increases agents become more confident that the transaction is in the
block chain and that \(A\) did, indeed, receive these coins.


    <figure>
    <img src="Bitcoin/Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: More Confidence in Older Blocks in the
    Chain</figcaption>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">What happens to Orphan Transactions?</h4>
An agent may append a block \(Y\) to its chain, and this block may be
dropped from the chains of all agents and never reappear after some
point. We saw a scenario in which this happens.
Such a block is an "orphan," because no agent has a record of that
transaction after some time.
If an orphan block contains the transaction in which you
sold your bicycle in exchange for coins, then will you ever be able to
spend your coins? Yes, you will get your coins as we see next.

<p>
Agents aggregate transactions that have not
appeared in the agent's block chain into blocks and propose to append these
blocks to the chain. A transaction that does not appear in block
chains will be agrregated eventually by some agent and inserted into
a block in the chian. Though the orphan block disappears the
transactions in the block do not.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Incentives</h2>
Next, looks look at challenge number 3. Why should an agent create
blocks of validated transactions?

<p>
Because the agent gets paid! Payment
is from either a <i>block reward</i> or transaction fees.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Block rewards</p>
An agent that creates a block gets a specified number of Bitcoins for
itself as a reward called a <i>block reward</i>.
The Bitcoins in a block reward are created by making the
block; these Bitcoins don't exist until the block is created. The process of making
blocks and acquiring block rewards is called "mining."
<i>Mining is the only way of creating new Bitcoins.</i>

<p>
When Bitcoin started the reward for creating a block was 50 Bitcoins.
The reward
halves after the creation of a certain number (210,000) of blocks. The
reward was reduced to 25 in 2013 and to 12.5 in 2018.
Block rewards will vanish at some point in the future.
The
total number of Bitcoins that can ever be created has an upper bound:
about 21 million.

<p>
(Bitcoins can be lost. An agent may lose the hash pointer to the
transaction that gave the agent ownership of the coin, or an agent may
lose its private key.)

<p>
Even when block rewards vanish, miners will continue to
mine provided that they get paid transaction fees. A
transaction fee is a payment by payers and payees to
miners. Transaction fees are voluntary. A high-fee for a
transaction is an incentive to miners to put this transaction into a
block quickly. So, it's possible that agents that offer no fee or low
fees may have to wait longer for their transactions to enter the
block chain. 

<p>
Incentives are critical for Bitcoin. Miners get paid to
get their blocks into the long-term "consensus" block chain.
Miners have an incentive to police the block chain because 
they don't get paid for appending erroneous blocks. If a miner appends
an erroneous block to the chain then other
miners won't extend chains containing the erroneous block, and so the
erroneous block will become an orphan.
<p>
Any agent can check whether its copy of the block chain is
valid; however, agents making ordinary transactions don't
need to do so because there are many miners each of whom has an
incentive to ensure that the block chain is legitimate.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Attacks</h2>
Next, looks look at challenge number 4.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Stealing coins</h3>
Can an agent steal a coin from an agent \(X\) by appending a block to
the chain where the block contains a transaction in which \(X\) gives
coins to \(Y\)?

<p>
No, this can't happen thanks to cryptography. A transaction into which
\(X\) puts coins is valid only if \(X\) signs the transaction.  \(Y\)
cannot forge \(X\)'s signature, and so \(Y\) cannot create blocks that
contain such fraudulent transactions.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Double spend</h3>
Can an agent spend the same coin twice? Can an agent buy something
without paying for it?

<p>
Consider the following transaction using conventional checks issued by
banks. A buyer gives a seller a check for $\(100,000\) for a house.
The house is put in escrow.  When the check clears and the seller
receives the payment the buyer gets possession of the house. The legal
process that includes notaries, real estate agents, and banks, helps
ensure that the transaction concludes correctly or is aborted correctly.

<p>
Next, let's look at a transaction in which a person buys a video
online by paying the seller Bitcoins. The buyer and seller know each
other by their public keys and by their online addresses. 
The buyer broadcasts the transaction in which the buyer gives the seller
the payment in Bitcoins.
The amount is specified as
a pair (transaction id, array index) described in the section <i>pay
transactions</i> in 
<a
href="./CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">
the module introducing crypto currencies.</a>

<p>
A miner puts the transaction into a block \(X\);
appends the block to its copy \(L\) of the block chain; and broadcasts the extended
block chain \(L + X\).
When the seller gets a copy of the block chain \(L + X\), the
seller concludes that it has received the payment from the
buyer because the 
transaction has been recorded in a block chain. So the seller gives
the video to the buyer.  

<p>
The buyer cheats. The buyer creates a transaction in which the buyer
transfers the same Bitcoins  to the buyer itself.
A miner creates a block \(Y\) that includes this transaction.
A miner who has only received block
chain \(L\) (and hasn't yet received chain \(L + X\)) appends \(Y\) to
\(L\) to get a chain \(L + Y\), and broacasts \(L + Y\).

<p>
Now we have a situation in which one
miner broadcasts a legitimate block chain \(L + X\) and a different
miner broadcasts a legitimate block chain \(L + Y\). Both chains have
the same length.
A miner with chain \(L + X\) does not know at this point that another
minder has chain \(L + Y\). So, miners will extend both block chains.
(Note that the algorithm will not permit chains \(L + X + Y\) or \(L +
Y + X\).) 

<p>
We've seen this situation before:  look at <i>block collisions</i> described
earlier in this module. Both block chains will be extended, but
eventually, with very high probability, one of the blocks \(X\) or
\(Y\) will drop out of chain.

<p class="w3-text-teal">
How should sellers protect themselves?
</p>

<p>
What is the equivalent of the buyer's check clearing in the bank?
<p>
A seller should give the item to the buyer only after the transaction
appears with high confidence in a block in the chain --- see Figure 1.
The seller listens to block chains broadcast by miners. If the seller
gets a block chain \(L + X + L'\) where \(L'\) is itself a long block chain
then the seller has high confidence that the transaction is in the
permanent record.

<p>
The seller waits to get block chains in which its transaction appears
in a block which is then followed by \(m\) blocks, for large
\(m\). The larger the value of \(m\), the greater the seller's
confidence, but the longer the buyer has to wait to get paid.
length of the extension \(L'\).
<a href="https://www.lopp.net/pdf/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf">
A value of \(m = 6\) gives adequate confidence in most cases.</a>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Fraudulent miners</h3>
A miner gets paid for every block the miner creates; so, why shouldn't
the miner create fraudulent blocks and get paid for them?

<p>
The answer is the same as that for the double-spending attack. A miner
may have 
created a block and appended it to the chain; however, a suspicious
agent (and we hope that all agents are suspicious!) will not accept
the block until many blocks have been appended to the chain after
it. Other miners won't append their blocks to an invalid one. The
invalid blocks will become permanent orphans, and so the fraudulent
miner won't be able to spend the coins in these blocks.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Fifty One Percent Attacks</h3>
A 51% attack can be carried out by an agent that has more mining
power (e.g. 51% or more) than all other agents combined. The higher
the proportion of mining power of a single agent, the greater the
chances that attacks by that agent will succeed. You can see the
danger of a single agent having predominant mining power by thinking
about an agent with say, 99% of the total mining power. This agent
can mine so much faster than others that it can manipulate the block
chain in many ways. It can create double-spend transactions and deny
services to some transactions.

<p>
A group of miners can collude to gain predominant mining power. Also,
miners can <i>rent</i> Cloud-based systems for mining --- as opposed to having to <i>own</i>
huge data centers. An attacker can rent a large system for the specific purpose and
duration of an attack. The public may not know if and when such
attacks are successful because
<a href="https://dci.mit.edu/51-attacks">cryptocurrencies do not have an
incentive to publish such attacks.</a>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Denial of service</h3>
Can agents collude so that an agent \(X\)'s transactions never get
into blocks and so never get processed?

<p>
An agent's identity does not appear in a transaction, only a public
key does. An agent can create new public keys at will. So let's ask
another question: can agents collude so that transactions with a
specific public key do not get into blocks?

<p>
Only an agent that can solve puzzles in reasonable time can make
blocks. These agents have significant computational power. One can
concoct a situation where many agents with significant computation
power collude to avoid transactions from a specific public key. This
could have the effect of slowing processing of certain
transactions. However, such a situation isn't likely to arise because
agents have an incentive to create blocks and so they compete ---
rather than collude --- with each other.
Colluding
agents, with massive computing power, may help to deny or slow service
to a public key but not to another agent because agents can create
public keys at will.

  How does the algorithm deal with the situation in which one agent
receives a message to extend its copy of the block chain with a block
\(X\) while another agent receives a message to extend its copy of the
  block chain with a different block \(Y\)?

  Could there be an infinite sequence of collisions? Is that likely?

  What is mining for cryptocurrency? Suppose only a small number (say
  two organizations) mined most (say 99%) of Bitcoins. Would that be a
  problem?
