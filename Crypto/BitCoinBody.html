<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module introduces the algorithm underlying BitCoin.
</h4>

    Bitcoin is based on cryptography and distributed consensus. We
    discussed aspects of cryptography required for Bitcoin in an
    <a
    href="../CryptoCurrencyIntroduction/CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">
    earlier module.</a> Now we focus on the distributed consensus
    algorithm used by BitCoin.
    
    <a href="https://www.lopp.net/pdf/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf">
    This Princeton University book
    has a superb (and longer) description of consensus in Bitcoin.</a>
    
    <p>
    We discussed distributed consensus in the modules on
    <a href="../Paxos/Paxos.html">Paxos</a> and
    <a href="../Byzantine/Byzantine.html">Byzantine Generals with
    written</a> and
    <a href="../Byzantine_Oral/Byzantine.html">oral messages.</a>
    The specification of consensus is weaker in
    Bitcoin and the algorithm used to obtain consensus is different
    from those used in Paxos and Byzantine Generals written and oral
    algorithms. 

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">No trusted agent</h3>
    In an earlier module we described an algorithm for a
    cryptocurrency that had many of the features that we expect froma
    cryptocurrency. That algorithm had, however, a
    characteristic which is problematic to some: It relies on a
    trusted agent.
    The BitCoin algorithm is a modification that eliminates the
    trusted agent from the previous algorithm.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">No assumptions about numbers of agents</h3>
    The Byzantine Generals algorithm uses an upper bound on the number
    of faulty agents. The oral version of the problem uses a lower
    bound on the number of non-faulty 
    agents. Paxos assumes that the total number of agents is known. 
    The BitCoin algorithm makes no assumptions about numbers of faulty and
    non-faulty agents other than that there are a large number of agents.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Incentives and transaction fees</h3>
When a currency is managed by a single trusted agent, such as a
bank, we assume that the bank gets some reward for its
service.
A bank may be paid by the government to carry out this service.
The BitCoin algorithm pays agents with Bitcoins for checking the validity of
transactions. This payment either consists of new coins


<h2 class="w3-text-teal">A First Proposal for an Algorithm</h2>
How can we modify the algorithm we described earlier so that it works
without a trusted agent? 
Let's try this modification:
Select random agents to play the role of the trusted manager.

<p>
A step of the algorithm is as follows:
A single agent is
chosen randomly to play the role of the trusted manager. This agent
receives and validates transactions, gathers some of the transactions
into a block, appends the block to the block chain, and
broadcasts the updated block chain. The
other agents update their copies of the block chain when they receive this
value. The system waits for all agents to update their copies and then
executes the next step.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Challenges of the Proposed Algorithm</h4>
This algorithm has several challenges.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Selecting a single agent.</i>
  How can the collection of agents select a <i>single</i> agent to add
  a block to the block chain? The selection of a single agent requires
  all agents to reach a consensus about which agent to 
  select. So, the solution to problem of agents coming to a consensus
  about the block chain requires the
  solution to another consensus problem. The BitCoin algorithm does
  not select a unique agent to add a block to the block chain;
  however, it uses an ingenious mechanism to ensure that multiple agents
  don't attempt to add blocks at about the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Synchronization</i>:
  How can the collection of agents wait long enough to ensure that all
  agents have updated their copies of the ledger to the most recent version before
  the ledger is modified again?
  <p>
  Consider the following example scenario.  All agents have the same
  copy x of the ledger at some point t. Agent B, selected randomly to
  act as the trusted agent, appends transaction y to the ledger at a
  later point t' at which point B's copy is [x, y].  Then, agent C,
  selected randomly to act as the trusted agent, appends transaction z
  to the ledger at a later point t''. If C's copy is still [x],
  because it has not as yet been updated to [x, y], then after C
  appends z to the ledger, C's copy becomes [x, z].
  <p>
  A nice property of the algorithm with the trusted agent is that two
  copies of the ledger are either identical or the longer copy
  consists of additional transactions appended to the
  shorter copy. With this property, two copies of the ledger are
  either identical or the shorter copy can eventually "catch up" to the longer copy by
  merely by appending more values.
  <p>
  In the example, B may receive
  information about transaction z after receiving information about
  transaction y, whereas C may receive this information in the reverse
  order, which leaves B's copy as [x, y, z] and C's copy as [x, z,
  y]. In this case, the copies remain different forever.
  <p>
  The BitCoin algorithm <i>does not guarantee synchronization</i>; however,
  its mechanism helps to make many agents append blocks in the same
  order. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Incentives</i>: 
  Why should an agent chosen to play the role of trusted agent agree
  to play that role? What's the incentive?
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Untrustworthy Agents</i>:
  The randomly-chosen trusted manager may not be trustworthy.
  </li>
</ol>
Next, let's look at how the Bitcoin algorithm addresses challenges 1
and 2. We'll look at challenges 3 and 4 later.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Selecting a Single Random Agent</h3>
How can an arbitrary set of agents, some of whom may be
malicious, and where the size of the set is unknown, pick a random
agent?
The BitCoin algorithm does so by using the <i>puzzle-friendly property</i> of cryptographic hash
functions discussed in the previous module.

<p>
Each agent has its own copy of the block chain.
An agent \(A\) collects a set of transactions that haven't as yet been added
to \(A\)'s copy of the block chain, and proposes to add a block consisting
of this set of transactions to the block chain. It proposes to add the block in the
following way.

<p>
Let \(ptr\) be the pointer to agent \(A\)'s copy of the block chain, and let
\(trans\) be the list of transactions that \(A\) proposes to make into a
block in the chain. 
Agent \(A\) can add a block containing \(trans\) to the chain only if it
proves that it has solved the following problem --- the "puzzle."
Find a number, called \(nonce\), such that:
<p>
\(H(nonce + ptr + trans) < target \)
<p>
where \(+\) is the concatenation operator , and <i>target</i> is a
given value. For the time being
assume that target is a constant; later, we'll see that it decreases very
slowly over time.
The smaller the value of <i>target</i> the
greater the expected time to solve the puzzle.

<p>
The value of <i>target</i> is set so that the time to solve a puzzle
is usually greater than the time required for a message broadcast
by an agent to reach most agents.
So, often most agents will
receive an update to the block chain proposed by one agent before an
update proposed by another agent.

<p>
The first challenge is: How can the collection of agents select a
<i>single</i> agent to add a block to the block chain?

The BitCoin algorithm overcomes this challenge most of the time. This is because
the time taken to solve a puzzle is a random variable. Each proposer
of a block is probably solving a different puzzle because its value of the
transaction list \(L\) is likely to be different from that of another
proposer of a block. Agents solving puzzles have different amounts of
computing capacity.
It is unlikely that
multiple proposers will solve their puzzles at about the same time.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Attempts at Synchronization</h3>
The second challenge is:
How can the collection of agents wait long enough to ensure that all
  agents have updated their copies of the ledger to the most recent version before
  the ledger is modified again?
The algorithm overcomes this challenge much of the time but not all of
the time.
<p>
The time between the point at which an agent solves its puzzle
and broadcasts an update and the point at which the next agent solves
its puzzle and broadcasts its update is often long enough that most
agents update their copies with the first update before receiving the
next update.

<p>
But "much of the time" isn't enough. 

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Managing Concurrent Updates</h3>
How does the algorithm deal with the following situation? One agent
receives a message to extend its copy of the block chain with a block
\(X\) while another agent receives a message to extend its copy of the
block chain with block \(Y\). Each agent will have a different copy of
the block chain. What is the equivalent of the "true" system-wide
block chain when different agents have different copies?

<p>
We can think
of this situation as arising from a time-collision between blocks
\(X\) and \(Y\). If block \(X\) got to all agents before block \(Y\)
did then the copies would eventually be the same. The Ethernet and
similar protocols handle such collisions by having agents cooperate using
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential
backoff</a> to reduce the likelihood of continuing collisions. How
does the BitCoin algorithm solve this problem without having agents
cooperate? 

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Key Step of the BitCoin Algorithm</h4>
The step of the BitCoin algorithm that updates local copies of block
chains is as follows. After an agent creates a block and appends the
newly created block to its local copy it broadcasts its copy of
the block chain. When an agent \(A\) gets a message containing a copy
of another agent's block chain, agent \(A\) sets its local copy to the
block chain in the message <i>if and only if</i> the length of the
block chain in the message exceeds the length of \(A\)'s local copy.

<p>
Let's look at a scenario. Assume that agent \(A\)'s copy of the block chain
is \(L\) when \(A\) receives a message containing the block chain \(L
+ X\). Because the length of the block chain \(L + X\) is bigger than \(A\)'s
copy, \(A\) sets its copy to \(L + X\).

<p>
Now suppose agent \(A\) gets a
message containing the block chain \(L + Y\); what does \(A\) do?
Agent \(A\) ignores the message because the length of \(L + Y\) is not
greater than \(A\)'s current copy which is now \(L + X\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Continuing Collisions</h4>
Let's continue with the following scenario. An agent with a block
chain copy \(L + 
X\), solves the puzzle and appends a block \(X_{1}\) to get a new copy
\(L + X + X_{1}\) of the block chain which the agent broadcasts. An
agent receives this copy; makes its copy \(L + X + X_{1}\);
then solves the puzzle; and then appends a block \(X_{2}\) to get a new copy
\(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2}\) of the block chain; which it broadcasts. When agent
\(A\) receives a message \(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2} + \ldots \) it sets
its local copy to this message. Block \(Y\) becomes an "orphan" block
as far as agent \(A\) is concerned.

<p>
It is possible, however, that additional time collisions will occur.
Just when an agent broadcasts \(L + X + X_{1}\) another
agent broadcasts \(L + Y + Y_{1}\), and so some agents set their 
copies to \(L + X + X_{1}\) while others set their copies to \(L + Y +
Y_{1}\). And just when an agent broadcasts \(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2}\) another
agent broadcasts \(L + Y + Y_{1} + Y_{2}\), 
and so the competition between block
chains of equal lengths could continue.
It is unlikely, however, that such collisions will continue for many
blocks.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Confidence that a Block is in the Chain</h4>
Suppose an agent's copy of the block chain is \(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2}
+ \ldots + X_{K}\). What is the likelihood
that most agents' copies of the block chain are of the form \(L + X +
\ldots\)? In other words, how likely is it that \(L + X\) is a prefix
of most copies? An equivalent version of the question is: How likely
is that some agents have copies \(L + X + X_{1} + X_{2}
+ \ldots + X_{K}\) while other agents have  \(L + Y + Y_{1} + \ldots\)
where \(Y \neq X\)? 

<p>
For \(L + X\) not to be a prefix of most block chains
there must be \(K\) collisions, and the likelihood of \(K\) collisions
decreases as \(K\) increases. For practical purposes,
many agents assume that if \(K > 6\) then \(L + X\) is a prefix of
most agents' block chains.

    <img src="BitCoin/Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: More Confidence in Older Blocks in the
    Chain</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Suppose agent \(A\) gets \(N\) BitCoins in transaction \(X\). If \(K =
0\) then an agent can't be confident that \(A\) ever received these coins
because this transaction may not persist in the block chain. As \(K\)
increases agents become more confident that the transaction is in the
block chain and that \(A\) did receive these coins.




<p class="w3-text-teal">What happens to Orphan Transactions?</p>
Agents gather transactions that have not
appeared in the agent's block chain into blocks and propose to append these
blocks to the chain. A transaction in an orphan block will appear
eventually in the block chain
because some agent will include it in a block which gets into the
chain.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Incentives</h2>
Next, looks look at challenge number 3. Why should an agent create
blocks of validated transactions?

<p>
Because the agent gets paid! Payment
is from either a <i>block reward</i> or transaction fees.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Block rewards</p>
An agent that creates a block gets a specified number of Bitcoins for
itself as a reward called a <i>block reward</i>.
The Bitcoins in a block reward are created by making the
block; these Bitcoins don't exist until the block is created. The process of making
blocks and acquiring block rewards is called "mining."
<i>Mining is the only way of creating new Bitcoins.</i>

<p>
When Bitcoin started the reward for creating a block was 50 Bitcoins.
The reward
halves after the creation of a certain number (210,000) of blocks. The
reward was reduced to 25 in 2013 and to 12.5 in 2018.
Block rewards will vanish at some point in the future.
The
total number of Bitcoins that can ever be created has an upper bound:
about 21 million.

<p>
(Bitcoins can be lost. An agent may lose the hash pointer to the
transaction that gave the agent ownership of the coin.)

<p>
When block rewards vanish, miners will get paid transaction fees. A
transaction fee is a payment by payers and payees to
miners. Transaction fees may be voluntary. A high-fee for a
transaction is an incentive to miners to put this transaction into a
block quickly. So, it's possible that agents that offer no fee or low
fees may have to wait a long time before their transactions enter the
block chain.

<p>
Incentives are critical for BitCoin. Miners get paid to
get their blocks into the long-term "consensus" block chain.
Miners have an incentive to police the block chain because 
they don't get paid for appending erroneous blocks. If a miner appends
an erroneous block to the chain then other
miners won't extend chains containing the erroneous block, and so the
erroneous block will become an orphan.
<p>
Any agent can check whether its copy of the block chain is
valid; however, agents making ordinary transactions don't
need to do so because there are many miners each of whom has an
incentive to ensure that the block chain is legitimate.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Attacks</h2>
Next, looks look at challenge number 4.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Stealing coins</h3>
Can an agent steal a coin from an agent \(X\) by appending a block to
the chain where the block contains a transaction in which \(X\) gives
coins to \(Y\)?

<p>
No, this can't happen thanks to cryptography. A transaction into which
\(X\) puts coins is valid only if \(X\) signs the transaction.  \(Y\)
cannot forge \(X\)'s signature, and so \(Y\) cannot create blocks that
contain such fraudulent transactions.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Double spend</h3>
Can an agent spend the same coin twice? Can an agent buy something
without paying for it?

<p>
Consider the following transaction using conventional checks issued by
banks. A buyer gives a seller a check for $\(\alpha\) for the
item. The item is put in escrow.  When the check clears and the seller
receives the payment the item is given to the buyer.

<p>
Next, let's execute this transaction using
BitCoins.


<p>
The buyer broadcasts a transaction in which the buyer gives the seller
the payment \(\alpha\) in BitCoins.
The amount \(\alpha\) is specified as
a pair (transaction id, array index) described in the section <i>pay
transactions</i> in 
<a
href=
"https://kmchandy.github.io/CryptoCurrencyIntroduction/CryptoCurrencyIntroduction.html">
the module introducing crypto currencies.</a>

<p>
A miner puts the transaction into a block \(X\);
appends the block to its copy \(L\) of the block chain; and broadcasts the extended
block chain \(L + X\).
The seller listens to block chains broadcast by miners.
When the seller gets a copy of the block chain \(L + X\), the
seller concludes that it has received the payment \(\alpha\) from the
buyer because the 
transaction has been recorded in a block chain. So the seller gives
the item to the buyer.  

<p>
The buyer cheats. The buyer creates a transaction in which the buyer
transfers the same BitCoins \(\alpha\) to the buyer itself.
A miner creates a block \(Y\) that includes this transaction.
A miner who has only received block
chain \(L\) (and hasn't yet received chain \(L + X\)) appends \(Y\) to
\(L\) to get a chain \(L + Y\), and broacasts \(L + Y\).

<p>
Now we have a situation in which one
miner broadcasts a legitimate block chain \(L + X\) and a different
miner broadcasts a legitimate block chain \(L + Y\). Both chains have
the same length; so, miners have no preference about which chain to
extend further.

<p>
We've seen this situation before:  look at <i>block collisions</i> described
earlier in this module. Both block chains will be extended, but
eventually, with very high probability, one of the blocks \(X\) or
\(Y\) will drop out of chain.

<p class="w3-text-teal">
How should sellers protect themselves?
</p>

<p>
What is the equivalent of the buyer's check clearing in the bank?
<p>
A seller should give the item to the buyer only after the transaction
appears with high confidence in a block in the chain --- see Figure 1.
The seller listens to block chains broadcast by miners. If the seller
gets a block chain \(L + X + L'\) where \(L'\) is itself a long block chain
then the seller has high confidence that the transaction is in the
permanent record.

<p>
The seller waits to get block chains in which its transaction appears
in a block which is then followed by \(m\) blocks, for large
\(m\). The larger the value of \(m\), the greater the seller's
confidence, but the longer the buyer has to wait to get paid.
length of the extension \(L'\).
<a href="https://www.lopp.net/pdf/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf">
A value of \(m = 6\) gives adequate confidence in most cases.</a>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Fraudulent miners</h3>
A miner gets paid for every block the miner creates; so, why shouldn't
the miner create fraudulent blocks and get paid for them?

<p>
The answer is the same as that for the double-spending attack. A miner
may have 
created a block and appended it to the chain; however, a suspicious
agent (and we hope that all agents are suspicious!) will not accept
the block until many blocks have been appended to the chain after
it. Other miners won't append their blocks to an invalid one. The
invalid blocks will become permanent orphans.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Denial of service</h3>
Can agents collude so that an agent \(X\)'s transactions never get
into blocks and so never get processed?

<p>
An agent's identity does not appear in a transaction, only a public
key does. An agent can create new public keys at will. So let's ask
another question: can agents collude so that transactions with a
specific public key do not get into blocks?

<p>
Only an agent that can solve puzzles in reasonable time can make
blocks. These agents have significant computational power. One can
concoct a situation where many agents with significant computation
power collude to avoid transactions from a specific public key. This
could have the effect of slowing processing of certain
transactions. However, such a situation isn't likely to arise because
agents have an incentive to create blocks and so they compete ---
rather than collude --- with each other.
