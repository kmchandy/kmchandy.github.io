    <!--------------------------------------------------------->

    This algorithm combines the global snapshot algorithm and
    diffusing computations to get an algorithm that is initiated by a
    <i>single agent which detects when the snapshot algorithm has
    terminated</i>.
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Single initiator of snapshot</p>

    <a
    href="https://kmchandy.github.io/DiffusingComputations/DiffusingComputations.html"> 
    An earlier module gave the rules for the global snapshot
    algorithm. </a>
    These rules allow multiple agents to start recording
    their states either independently or when they receive markers
    from other agents who have recorded their own states. Now,
    let's design an algorithm in which a single agent, called the
    <i>initiator</i> is the only agent that records its state
    independently, and all other agents record their 
    states only when they receive markers.
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Initiator detects termination of snapshot</p>

    A global snapshot is complete when all agents have recorded their
    own states and the states of all incoming channels.
    The rules for the snapshot algorithm don't specify how an agent
    detects that the global snapshot is complete.
    Now let's look at an algorithm by which the initiator
    detects that the snapshot algorithm is over.
    In this algorithm the initiator does not get the local snapshots
    of all the agents; the initiator merely detects that the states of
    all agents and channels have been recorded.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Specification</h4>
    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
    A system is as specified in diffusing computations. There is a
    channel from agent \(x\) to agent \(y\) if and only there is a
    channel from \(y\) to \(x\). All agents are reachable, by a
    sequence of channels from an agent called the <i>initiator.</i>
    <p>
    Modify the global snapshot algorithm so that it is started by a
    single agent which detects that the algorithm has
    terminated. 

    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Solution: Combine Algorithms</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
The solution is a diffusing computation algorithm which takes global
snapshots.
<p>
A message in the diffusing computation is a marker in the
snapshot algorithm.
When a message (i.e. marker) is
    received by an idle agent the agent becomes active, sends messages
    (i.e., markers)
specified by the snapshot algorithm, and becomes idle.

<p>
The diffusing computation terminates when all agents are idle and all
channels are empty.
So the computation terminates when each agent has completed its step
    of the snapshot algorithm, and when all markers have been
received.
This implies that at termination the states of all
agents and channels have finished
being recorded.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Initiator Acquires
    the Global Snapshot</h2>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
In the algorithm given above the initiator detects that the global
    snapshot is complete --- i.e., each agent has
    finished recording its state and the states of its incoming
    channels. The algorithm does not show how the local information of
each agent is sent to the initiator. An algorithm to send agent
    information to the initiator
operates in two phases.
<ol>
  <li>
  Execute a diffusing computation in which the initiator detects that
  a global snapshot is complete.
  </li>
  <li>
  Initiate the
<a
  href="https://kmchandy.github.io/ApplicationsDiffusingComputation/ApplicationsDiffusingComputation.html">
  algorithm to acquire graph information.</a>
  The information that is acquired from each agent is its recorded state and
  the recorded states of its incoming channels.
