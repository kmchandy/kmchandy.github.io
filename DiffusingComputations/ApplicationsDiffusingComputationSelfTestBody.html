<p>
    This problem is to apply the
    <a href="ApplicationsDiffusingComputationExample.html">algorithm in which the initiator takes a
global snapshot and then acquires the global snapshot.</a>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</p>
    The system has a set of indivisible indestructible tokens. Tokens
    are not created. So the number of tokens in the system is a
    constant.

    <p>
    Agents may hold tokens and agents may send tokens. So, at any
    point tokens may be at agents or in transit in
    channels.

    <p>
    Design an algorithm by which the initiator detects the number of
    tokens in the system.

    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Solution</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
Use the algorithm in which the initiator takes a
global snapshot and then acquires the global snapshot.
The state of an agent is the number of tokens it holds.
The state of a channel is the number of tokens in transit along the
    channel. The local information \(x.v\) that agent \(x\) sends to the
    initiator is the total number of tokens in agent \(x\) and in
incoming channels of agent \(x\).

<p>
We don't need to prove the correctness of this algorithm because it is
a special case of the algorithm in which the initiator takes and then
acquires a global snapshot.

    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Optimization</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
The algorithm in which the initiator takes a
global snapshot and then acquires the global snapshot can be optimized
    by merging the two phases. Instead of first waiting for the
    initiator to determine that the global snapshot is complete and
    only then
    initiating the algorithm to acquire all the local information, the
    two phases can operate concurrently. The algorithm with the merged
    phases is straightforward and is not given here.
