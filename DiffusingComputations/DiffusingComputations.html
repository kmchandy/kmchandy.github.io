    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h2>
    <p  class="w3-text-teal">Diffusing Computations</p>
    This module describes diffusing computations.
    An agent can use diffusing computations to learn about the
    structure of the  network
    in which the agent operates. For example, an agent can use
    diffusing computations to determine the number of agents in the
    network or to determine if the system is deadlocked.
    
    <p  class="w3-text-teal">Data Structures Modified by Multiple
    Agents Concurrently</p>
    The module shows how data structures --- in this case a tree ---
    play critical roles in distributed algorithms just as they do in
    sequential algorithms.
    The algorithm maintains the invariants that
    define the data structure even though the structure is modified
    concurrently by multiple agents.

    <p  class="w3-text-teal">An Application of Agent Knowledge</p>
    We use the concept of
    <a href="../Knowledge/Knowledge.html"><i>what an
    agent knows</i></a> to ensure that an agent modifies the data
    structure only when
    it know that it can do so while maintaining the invariants that
    define the structure.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>
    In this module we deal with systems in which an agent is either
    <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. An idle agent remains idle until it
    receives a message at which point it becomes active. An idle agent
    does not send messages. An active agent may send messages. An
    active agent may become idle at any time.

    <p>
    Initially, the system has a single active agent. This agent is
    called <i>the initiator</i>. Initially all channels are empty.

    The computation terminates exactly when all agents
    are idle and all channels are empty.

    <p>
    The computation may never
    terminate. Our first problem is to design an algorithm that
    enables the initiator to know 
    that the computation has terminated if it terminates. Later, we
    will extend this algorithm to enable the initiator to learn about
    the network.

    <p>
    In this system, for every channel from an agent \(x\) to an agent
    \(y\), there is a channel from \(y\) to \(x\). For any pair \(x,
    y\) of agents there exists at most one channel from \(x\) to
    \(y\), and at most one channel from \(y\) to \(x\).
                                                                                                      
    <p>
    An agent \(y\) sends an <i>ack</i> (acknowledgment) along channel
\((y, x)\) after receiving a message along channel \((x, y)\).
An ack is different from a message; so acks aren't acked.
<p>
Initially all channels are empty: there are no messages or acks in
transit along channels.
Let
    \(x.num\_unacked\) be the number of \(x\)'s unacknowledge
    messages, i.e, the number of messages that \(x\) has sent
    minus the number of acks that \(x\) has received. 
<a href="../Knowledge/Knowledge.html">Agent \(x\) knows</a>
that there are no messages in any of its outgoing channels when
\(x.num\_unacked = 0\).

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">A Rooted Tree</h3>
The theorems on knowledge tell us that for an agent to become active there
 must be a chain of messages from the initiator to the
agent.
A data structure
with paths between the initiator and active agents is a tree,
rooted at the initiator, and which spans active agents.
 For each agent \(x\) let \(x.parent\) be either \(null\) or an agent
which is
\(x\)'s parent in the tree. Agent \(x\) is not on the tree exactly
when \(x.parent = null\).

<p>
We will prove the following invariants.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Invariants</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
  The tree is rooted at the initiator, i.e.
  if \(x.parent \neq null\) then the initiator is an
  <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor">ancestor</a>
  of \(x\).
  </li>
  <li>
  An agent is off the tree exactly when the agent is idle and the
  agent has no unacknowledged messages:
  <p>
  \(
  (x.parent = null) \quad \equiv \quad x.idle \wedge
  (x.num\_unacked = 0)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(x\)'s parent is not \(null\) then \(x\)'s parent has at least
  one unacknowledged message.
  <p>
  \(
  x.parent \neq null \quad \Rightarrow \quad x.parent.num\_unacked > 0
  \)
</ol>
From invariant 3, it follows that an agent has no children if it has
no unacknowledged messages. So, from invariant 1, if the initiator has
no unacknowledged messages then all agents, apart from the initiator,
are idle and have no messages in outgoing channels. Therefore
computation has terminated when
<p>
\(
initiator.idle \wedge (initiator.num\_unacked = 0)
\)
<p>
So, the initiator knows that the computation has terminated when the
initiator is idle and no unacknowledged messages.
Next we give an algorithm that maintains the above invariants.




<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Program for an agent</h1>
Next we propose a program for an agent \(x\)
other than the initiator.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Program</h4>
<pre>
0: initially:
      x.parent = null
      x.idle = True
      x.num_unacked = 0

1. When x sends a message:
      x.num_unacked = x.num_unacked + 1

2. When x receives a message from y:
      x.idle = False
      if x.parent = null:
         x.parent = y
      else
         send ack to y

3. When x receives an ack:
      x.num_unacked = x.num_unacked - 1
      if (x.num_unacked == 0) and x.idle:
              send ack to x.parent
              x.parent = null

4. When x becomes idle:
       x.idle = True
       if x.num_unacked == 0:
              send ack to x.parent
              x.parent = null
</pre>

<p class="w3-text-teal">The Initiator</p>
The program for the initiator is the same except that initially the
initiator is active. Also, to keep the exposition uniform for the
initiator and the other agents, we assume that the initiator has a
parent which is not one of the agents of the network. We call the initiator's parent
\(external\). This agent plays no role other than to keep the proofs
identical for the invariant and other agents. 
<pre>
initiator.parent = external
initiator.idle = False
initiator.num_unacked = 0
external.num_unacked = 1
</pre>


<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h2>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Safety</p>
The proof that the invariants are satisfied is carried out by showing
that they hold initially and then verifying that
each of the four commands maintains the invariants. The verification
step is straightforward if a bit laborious.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Progress</p>

<p>
If all agents are idle and there are no messages in channels then
the underlying computation has terminated.
We will prove that if the underlying computation does terminate then
the detection algorithm terminates as well, i.e. the tree
vanishes, and at that point the initiator knows that the computation has
terminated.
After the underlying computation terminates, the only action that
executes is action 3: receiving an ack. 

<p>A variant function is
the following graph. A
vertex \(x\) is in the graph exactly when \(x.parent\) is not null or
there is an ack in transit along the channel from \(x\) to its parent.
Define a partial order \(<\) between graphs as \(G \leq G'\)
when \(G\) is a subgraph of \(G'\). This graph is a tree because the
only pending acks are from a vertex to its parent (rule 3).

<p>
Next we prove that every execution of an action while the variant
function is not the empty graph reduces the variant function.
When all acks are delivered to \(y\), it sends an ack to its parent.
So while the tree is not empty there is an ack in some channel.
When \(y\) receives an ack from \(x\), the edge \((x, y)\) is
deleted from the tree. Therefore every
execution of action 3 reduces the variant function.
