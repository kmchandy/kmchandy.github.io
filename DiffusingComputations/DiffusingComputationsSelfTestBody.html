    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h3>
    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
    In this module we differentiate between acks and messages. An ack
    travels along channels exactly like a message does; however, we
    use acks only to acknowledge messages. So acks are not themselves
    acknowledged. 

    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part a</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then which of the
    following is True
    <ol>
      <li>
      At that point agent \(y\) is on the tree, i.e., \(y.parent \neq
      null\)
      </li>
      <li>
      At that point agent \(y\) is not on the tree, i.e., \(y.parent =
      null\)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part b</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then what action
    does \(x\) take if \(x.parent = null\)?
    
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part c</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then what action
    does \(x\) take if \(x.parent \neq null\)?
    
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part d</p>
    If <code>x.num_unacked = 0</code> then which of the following is
    True?
    <ol>
      <li>
      There are no messages in \(x\)'s outgoing channels.
      </li>
      <li>
      \(x\) has no descendants.
      </li>
      <li>
      There are no acks in \(x\)'s incoming channels
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part e</p>
    True or False?
    <p>
    If \(x.parent = y\), then \(x\) has received more messages from
    \(y\) than \(x\) has sent acks to \(y\).

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part f</p>
    True or False?
    <p>
    If \(x.parent = y\), and \(w\) is different from \(x\) and \(y\),
    then \(x\) has received more messages from \(w\) than \(x\) has
    sent acks to \(w\).

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h3>
    <!--------------------------------------------------------->

    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part a</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then which of the
    following is True
    <ol>
      <li>
      At that point agent \(y\) is on the tree, i.e., \(y.parent \neq
      null\)
      </li>
      <li>
      At that point agent \(y\) is not on the tree, i.e., \(y.parent =
      null\)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part a: Answer</p>
    At that point agent \(y\) is on the tree, i.e., \(y.parent \neq
    null\).
    <p>
    This is because if there is a message in an outgoing channel from
    \(y\) then \(y\) is on the tree.
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part b</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then what action
    does \(x\) take if \(x.parent = null\)?
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part b: Answer</p>
    Agent \(x\) sets \(x.parent = y\) and does not (immediately) send
    an ack to \(y\) for that message.
    
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part c</p>
    
    When agent \(x\) gets a message from agent \(y\) then what action
    does \(x\) take if \(x.parent \neq null\)?
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part c: Answer</p>
    Agent \(x\) sends an ack to \(y\) and leaves \(x.parent\) unchanged.
    
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part d</p>
    If <code>x.num_unacked = 0</code> then which of the following is
    True?
    <ol>
      <li>
      There are no messages in \(x\)'s outgoing channels.
      </li>
      <li>
      \(x\) has no descendants.
      </li>
      <li>
      There are no acks in \(x\)'s incoming channels
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part d: Answer</p>
    All are True. 

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part e</p>
    True or False?
    <p>
    If \(x.parent = y\), then \(x\) has received more messages from
    \(y\) than \(x\) has sent acks to \(y\).
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part e: Answer</p>
    True.
    <p>
    \(x\) has received one more message than it has acknowledged.

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part f</p>
    True or False?
    <p>
    If \(x.parent = y\), and \(w\) is different from \(x\) and \(y\),
    then \(x\) has received more messages from \(w\) than \(x\) has
    sent acks to \(w\). 
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Part f: Answer</p>
    False.
    <p>
    \(x\) immediately acknowledges messages from agents other than its
    predecessors.
