    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Message Passing</h1>
    <p>
    This module describes different mechanisms for passing messages
    between agents and also describes mechanisms by which agents can
    operate on shared variables.
    </p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">A Distributed System Model</h2>

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Labeled Graph: Agent - Vertex; Channel - Edge</h3>

    <p>
    Different models of distributed systems are appropriate for
    different problems. A common model has a distributed system as a
    network of agents and message-passing channels represented as a
    labeled directed graph in which vertices represent agents and
    edges represent channels. Consider a channel labeled \(c\) from an
    agent \(v\) to an agent \(w\); agent \(v\) can send messages on
    the channel and agent \(w\) can get messages sent on the
    channel. Only \(v\) can send messages on \(c\) and only \(w\) can
    get messages from \(c\). The system may have many channels, with
    different labels, from \(v\) to \(w\).
    </p>

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Channel: Queue of Messages</h3>
    <p>
    There are different models for channels; the most common is that
    channel 
    is a
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">
    queue</a>.
    The state of a queue is the sequence of values in the queue.
    An agent sends a message \(m\) on a channel \(c\) by appending
    \(m\) to the tail of the sequence of messages in the queue.
    An agent receives a message on a nonempty channel by dequeueing
    the message from the head of the queue.
    </p>

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">States and Transitions of the System</h3>
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">System State</p>
    <p>
    The state of the system is given by the states of its component
    agents and the states of its component channels. It can be
    represented by a tuple of agent states and a tuple of channel
    states. The states of agents are arbitrary, and the states of
    channels are sequences of messages. Next, we define the state
transitions of the system.
</p>


<p class="w3-text-teal">System State Transitions</p>
    <p>
The state transitions of the system are due to an agent sending or
    receiving a message or a state transition of an agent without
    sending or receiving messages. When the system makes a state
    transition due to an agent sending or receiving a message on a
    channel, the states of that agent and channel may change, while
    the states of all other agents and channels remain
    unchanged. Likewise when an agent makes a state transition without
    communication then the states of all other agents and all channels
remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>
We next define these
transitions.
</p>

<p>
An agent \(a\) is a state-transition system where the transitions are
defined by the relations \(receive\), \(send\),  and \(internal\)
which are explained next. The relations \(receive\) and \(send\) are
3-tuples \(s, m, s'\), where \(s\) and \(s'\) are states of agent
\(a\) and \(m\) is a messages. The relation \(internal\) is a 2-tuple
\(s, s'\) where \(s\) and \(s'\) are states of agent \(a\).
</p>

<p>
The
relation \(receive\) specifies the state transitions that an agent can
make when it is in state \(s\) and  receives a message \(m\).
The relation \(send\) specifies the state transitions that an agent
can make and the messages that it can
send when it is in state \(s\).
</p>

<p>
The state transitions of a system are characterized as follows:

  <p>
  1. An agent \(a\) receives a message \(m\) from a nonempty channel
  \(c\).
  </p>

  <p>
  Let \(s\) and \(r\) be the states of \(a\) and \(c\), respectively,
  before the transition.
  Then \(r\) is a nonempty sequence of messages.
  The state of channel \(c\) after the transition is obtained from \(r\)
  by deleting the message at the head of \(r\). Let \(m\)
  be the message at the head of \(r\).
  The next state of agent \(a\) is any state \(s'\) where \(s, m, s'
  \in receive\).
</p>

<p>
  1. An agent \(a\) sends a message \(m\) on a channel
  \(c\).
  </p>

  <p>
  Let \(s\) and \(r\) be the states of \(a\) and \(c\), respectively,
  before the transition.
  Then \(r\) is a nonempty sequence of messages.
  The state of channel \(c\) after the transition is obtained from \(r\)
  by deleting the message at the head of \(r\). Let \(m\)
  be the message at the head of \(r\).
  The next state of agent \(a\) is any state \(s'\) where \(s, m, s'
  \in receive\).
  </p>


  
    <p>
    An agent is a state-transition system where an agent in a state
    \(s\) can:
    <ol>
      <li>
      <i>Get a message</i> from a non-empty queue and transit to a
      next state.  This action dequeues the message at the head of the
      non-empty queue. Let \(m\) be the message that is dequeued. Then
      the next state \(s'\) is defined by a relation \(R\) of 3-tuples
      \(s, m, s')\) where \(s\) and \(s'\) are states and \(m\) is a
      message.  If the agent in state \(s\) gets message \(m\) from
      any channel then the agent transits to a state \(s'\) where \(s,
      m, s'\) is in \(R\).
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Send a message</i> \(m\) and transit to a next state.
      This action appends \(m\) to the tail of the queue. The message
    that is sent and the next state are defined by a relation \(s, m,
    s')\). 
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Transit state without sending or receiving messages</i>
      The system transits from one state to another.
      </li>
    </ol>
