<h1 style="color:red;">Example: Safe File Access</h1>
  We want to develop an algorithm by which agents in a distributed
  system share access to a set of files. Safety means that each file
  is modified by at most one agent at a time, and no agent reads a
  file while it is being modified by another agent.  The state of the
  system is specified by the states of the agents and the states of
  message channels. In the graph representation, the system is at one
  vertex, representing a state, at any point in time. We will show
  that the paths that the system takes in the graph visit only safe
  states.
  </p>

  <p>
  We will show that a system progresses towards desired or goal states
  from properties of sets of infinite paths in graphs.
