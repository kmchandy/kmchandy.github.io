<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Applications of Global Snapshots</h1>
Timelines, consistent cuts and global snapshots have many
applications, some of which are described below.
<p>
The applications are based on the following theorem.
Let the states in which a global snapshot algorithm starts and ends be
\(s_{init}\) and \(s_{fini}\), respectively, and let \(s_{snap}\) be
the snapshot determined by the algorithm.
A key theorem is 
<hr class="new2">
    <h5 style="color:blue;">
There exists a trajectory from \(s_{init}\) through \(s_{snap}\) to
\(s_{fini}\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Rollback and Recovery</h4>
When a rollback and recovery algorithm detects an error it rolls the computation back
and restarts it from the most recent saved state.
In a distributed system the saved state is a global snapshot.
There is a trajectory that starts in \(s_{init}\) visits the global
snapshot \(s_{snap}\) and then continues execution.
So, if an error is detected, the computation is rolled
back to \(s_{snap}\) rather than to \(s_{init}\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Detecting Stable Predicates</h4>
A stable predicate is a predicate with the following property: If the
predicate holds at any point in any trajectory then it continues to
hold forever thereafter in that trajectory. Equivalently, if a stable
predicate holds in a state \(s\) then it holds in all states reachable
from \(s\).
<p>
An example of a stable predicate is: The computation has terminated.
If a computation has terminated at some point then it remains
terminated thereafter.

<p>
The Boolean --- "predicate \(P\) holds in state \(s\)" --- is written
as \(P(s)\). If \(P\) is stable and it holds in \(s_{init}\) then it
continues to hold thereafter, and therefore holds in \(s_{snap}\) and
in \(s_{fini}\). Likewise, if \(P\) is stable and it holds in
\(s_{snap}\) then it holds in \(s_{fini}\).

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
For a stable property \(P\):
<br>
\(
   P(s_{init}) \Rightarrow P(s_{snap})
\)
<br>
\(
   P(s_{snap}) \Rightarrow P(s_{fini})
\)

Modules in this chapter give examples of algorithms that detect stable
predicates.
