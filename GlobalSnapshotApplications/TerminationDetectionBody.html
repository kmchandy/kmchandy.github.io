    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Termination Detection</h1>

    This module shows how the concepts of consistent cuts
    and global snapshots are used to detect termination of a
    computation.
    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h4>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Active and Idle States of Agents</p>
    An agent is either <i>idle</i> or <i>active</i>. An idle agent
    remains idle until it receives a message at which point it becomes
active.
An idle agent does not
send messages.

<p>An active agent may send messages. An active agent
may become idle at any point.

<p>
    Initially all agents are active and all channels are empty.

    <p class="w3-text-teal">System in Terminated State</p>
    A <i>terminated</i> state of the system is one in which all agents
    are idle and all channels are empty. <i>terminated</i> is stable:
    a system in a terminated state remains terminated thereafter. A
    system may or may not enter a terminated state.
    <p>
    The problem is to develop an algorithm that detects that the system has
entered a terminated state.
The algorithm may use messages and agents that are not part of the
underlying computation.
The algorithm is part of the distributed operating system whereas the
    underlying computation is part of a user application which isn't
modified by the operating system.

<p>
The algorithm returns a Boolean variable where:
<ol>
  <li>
  If the algorithm starts after the system has terminated then
  the algorithm returns True.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the algorithm returns True then the system has terminated when
    the algorithm terminates
  </li>
</ol>
  

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Channel Counts</p>

    <p>
    For each channel \(C\), let  \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\), be the numbers of
    messages sent and received along \(C\), respectively.
    Initially \(C_{s} = C_{r} = 0\)

    The number of messages in transit along \(C\) is \(C_{s} -
    C_{r}\).
    
    <p>
    The system is in a terminated state exactly when the following
      All agents are idle, and
      for each channel \(C\): \(C_{s} = C_{r}\)



    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">The Detector</h2>
    The algorithm uses an agent, which is not part of the system, to
    carry out the detection. We call this agent <i>the
    detector</i>. 

    <p>
    When an agent transits from active to idle it sends a message to
    the detector containing copies of its local variables, \(C_{s}\)
    for every outgoing channel of the agent, and \(C_{r}\) for every
    incoming channel of the agent. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">The Detector's Local Variables</p>
The detector has its own local variables \(C'_{s}\) and \(C'_{r}\) for every
channel \(C\) in the system.
Initially the values of these local variables are 0.
When a detector gets a message from an
agent it sets the values of its local variables \(C'_{s}\) and \(C'_{r}\) to the
values of \(C_{s}\) and \(C_{r}\) in the message.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Initial Condition for the Detector's Local Variables</p>
Initially, for all channels \(C\), \(C'_{s} = 0\).
We will assume \(C'_{r} = -1\) so that \(C'_{s} > C'_{r}\). The
negative one for \(C'_{r}\) is merely a technical trick to simplify
the termination detection condition.

<hr class="new2">
<h4 style="color:blue;">The Detector detects termination when
for all channels \(C\): 
\(
C'_{s} = C'_{r}
\)
<h4>
    <hr class="new2">



<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h2>
The values of the detector's local variables, \(C'_{s}, C'_{r}\) for
each channel \(C\) are the values \(C_{s}, C_{r}\) sent by the agents
at some cut. From the theorem on consistent cuts, this cut
is consistent if and only if, for all channels \(C\): 
<p>
\(C'_{s} \geq C'_{r} \geq 0\)
<p>
Therefore the detector detects termination based on a consistent
cut. The result follows because termination is stable.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h2>
This module showed how to apply the concepts of consistent cuts and
global snapshots to solve detection problems. The module describes an
algorithm for detecting termination of distributed computations.
