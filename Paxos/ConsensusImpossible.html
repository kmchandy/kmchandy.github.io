  This page outlines the idea behind the proof that consensus is
  impossible in distributed systems that may have faulty agents and in
  which message delays are arbitrary.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Importance of Consensus Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Algorithms by which groups of agents <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">
come to a consensus </a> are among the most fundamental in
distributed computing.
  </p>

<p>
  There are many problems in which messages are sent to groups of
agents who collectively maintain a common <i>consensus</i> state.
Multiple agents reduce the possibility of system-wide failure due to
the failure of a single agent.  For example, a bank may use a group of
agents, rather than a single agent, to maintain bank balances.
  </p>

  <p>
  Managing replicated databases requires the replications to come to a
consensus on the sequence of transactions that is applied to the
database. Cryptocurrency transactions require agents to come to a
consensus about sequences of transactions that use crypto coins.
  </p>

<p>
In a control system with multiple and actuators, the actuators have to
come to a consensus about the state of the environment so that they
can operate in concert. A vehicle would crash if some actuators caused
the vehicle to accelerate while other actuators applied brakes.  In
some applications, multiple agents have to come to a consensus to
  elect a single leader. 
There are many problems in which agents have to reach a consensus.

  <div id="SECTION", class="Impossibility">

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Consensus: Impossible with a
    faulty agent</h3>
    Consensus is impossible with even a single faulty agent. This was
proved by
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3149.214121">
Fischer, Lynch and Patterson.
</a>

    <p>
    You can get the idea of why consensus is not possible by
    considering the following problem in which
message delays are finite but arbitrarily long, and in which agents
may fail by halting forever.
</p>

<p>
    A collection of 2N + 1 agents want to
    come to a consensus about a color. N of the agents pick blue and
    N+1 pick red. One of the red agents is arbitrarily slow. The
    2N non-slow agents exchange messages among each other, and each of
    these 2N agents gets N votes for red and N votes for blue. Agents
    decide to take a majority vote, and in the event of a tie pick
blue.
</p>


<figure>
    <img src="./Slide01.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Problem with a slow agent</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>
    How long should they wait for the slow agent?
</p>

    <p>
    Consider an algorithm in which agent waits until its local clock
    shows an elapsed time of T and then makes a decision based on the
    votes that it has.  An agent Y gets N red and N blue votes when
    its clock shows an elapsed time of T, and agent Y decides that the
    consensus is blue. Another agent Z has a slower clock and gets a
    red vote from the slow agent for a total of N+1 red votes, before
    Z's clock shows an elapsed time of T. So Z determines that the
    consensus is red. The algorithm fails because Y and Z have not
come to a consensus.
</p>

<p>
No algorithm is guaranteed to come to a consensus in finite time if
messages or agents can be arbitrarily slow because algorithms cannot
distinguish between slow agents and agents that have halted.
Systems with synchronized clocks don't have this 
problem. Later, we'll look at consensus algorithms for systems in which
agents operate in synchronized rounds.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Best Effort Consensus</h3>
<p>
The theorem says that there is no algorithm that guarentees that
consensus can be reached in all scenarios; 
however, consensus can be reached in most practical situations.
</p>

<p>
An idea to overcome the problem identified in the counterexample given
above is as follows: Agents keep trying repeatedly until they reach
consensus. The theorem tells us that the agents may have to keep
trying for ever. We expect, however, that in most practical situations
their attempts will succeed at some point.
A "best effort" algorithm may not terminate; but, if it does terminate
then it terminates in a state in which the collection of agents have
reached a consensus.
</p>

<p>
What does "keep trying" mean? When does one trial
end and the next one begin? If agents use timeouts to end a trial,
then --- because clocks aren't synchronized --- the timeouts may complete
at different times.
In the next pages we will see that we can use the idea of time, even
    though clocks aren't synchronized, to design a best-effort consensus
    algorithm.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Next</h4>
    Next we see how ideas similar to logical times,
    can be used to <a href="ReadWriteLossyChannels.html">
    serialize transactions in faulty systems.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Serializability plays a key role in the development of the
    consensus algorithm, <a href="StableMajority.html">Paxos.</a>
    Later, we will study <a href="../Byzantine/ByzantineWritten.html">
    Byzantine consensus</a> and
    <a href="../Crypto/BitCoin.html">consensus using block chain</a>.
