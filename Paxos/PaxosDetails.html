  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Serial Transactions on Faulty Systems</h2> 
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->

  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Clients and Servers</h4>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->  
A distributed system has agents, called <i>clients</i> that send
  requests to agents, called <i>servers</i>, to read and
  write local variables of servers.

  Each server <code>q</code> has a local variable <code>q.v</code>.

  A server  <code>q</code> receives messages from clients to read or
  write <code>q.v</code>.

  <p>
  When a server <code>q</code> receives a read request from a client
  <code>p</code>, the server sends a reply containing
  <code>q.v</code> to <code>p</code>.

  When <code>q</code> receives a write request, containing the value
  <code>w</code> to be written, <code>q</code> executes <code>q.v =
  w</code>.

  The only actions of a server are to respond to requests.

  <p>
  Associated with each client is a clock that sends the client
  a sequence of <i>clock tick</i> messages.
  
  The intervals between clock tick messages are irrelevant for the
  correctness of the algorithm, but play a role in the algorithm's
  performance.
  
  The only actions of a client are to send requests to servers, receive
  replies from servers, and receive clock tick messages.

  <p>



  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Lossy Channels</h4>
  We design an algorithm for a system in which agents may
  halt and messages may be duplicated,
  lost, and delivered out of order.

  Requests by clients to servers, and replies from servers may be
  lost, and so a client may never receive a reply.

<p>
  Clients avoid waiting forever for a reply by taking the following
steps.

A client sends requests to
servers when the client receives a clock tick message.

A client only accepts replies that arrive before the client receives
its next clock tick.


  <!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Transactions in a System with a Single
Client</h4>

We begin by considering a system with a single client <code>p</code>.

A client carries out a sequence of transactions.

Each transaction is simple: a client reads and writes server values.

The transaction uses a constant <code>M</code>.

Each client <code>p</code> has a local variable <code>p.copy</code>
which is a dictionary and where <code>p.copy[q]</code> contains a
(possibly stale) copy of <code>q.v</code>.


A transaction is as follows.

  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Read</h5>
  <code>p</code> sends read requests to all servers.
  Requests may be lost.
  Servers that receive requests send replies, but replies may be lost.
  
  Let <code>R</code> be the subset of servers from
  which <code>p</code> receives replies to its read requests.
  
  For each <code>q</code> in <code>R</code>: <code>p</code>
  copies the value, <code>q.v</code>, in the reply into 
  <code>p</code>'s local variable <code>p.copy[q]</code>.

  <p>
  If <code>p.copy</code> has more than <code>M</code> elements then
  the client executes the write step.
  
  If <code>p.copy</code> has <code>M</code> or fewer elements then the
   transaction terminates without executing the write step.


  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Write</h5>
  <code>p</code> requests each server <code>q</code> to assign
  <code>p.f()</code> to <code>q.v</code> where <code>f()</code> is a
given function.

Some requests may be losts.

Let <code>W</code> be the set of servers that receive and process
write requests.


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">The  Transaction</h5>
A  transaction by a client <code>p</code> is as follows.

<pre>
select arbitrary subset R of servers
p.copy = {}
for q in R: p.copy[q] = q.v

if len(p.copy) >= M:
   select arbitrary subset W of servers
   for q in W: q.v = p.f()
</pre>



<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Serializable Computations</h4>

A dataflow graph is <i>serializable</i> if it can be partitioned into
a sequence of subgraphs where each subgraph is the dataflow graph of a
single transaction.

<p>
An equivalent definition in terms of computations is as follows.

A computation \(X\) is serializable if there exists a
computation \(Y\) which is a permutation of \(X\) where \(Y\) is a
sequence of  transactions.

The sequence of  transactions in \(Y\) can represented by the
following iteration.


<pre>
while True:
   select an arbitrary client p
   p executes a  transaction
</pre>


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

The problem is to design an algorithm with multiple
clients such that computations are serializable.

<p>
The challenge is to design an algorithm in which the execution of a
 transaction by one client doesn't modify the execution of a
 transaction by another client though both clients are
executing transactions concurrently.

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach The Problem?</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

What method comes to mind to partition a dataflow graph into dataflow
subgraphs? 

Logical time partitions dataflow into a dataflow of the past at
logical time \(t\) and a dataflow of the future at logical time \(t\).

The state of the system after the past at \(t\) and before the future
at \(t\) is the global snapshot at logical time \(t\).

We use a similar mechanism.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Logical Times and Epochs</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Logical clocks assign a logical time \(t(e)\) to each step \(e\) such
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) < t(e')\).


<p>
In this algorithm, we assign a value \(t(e)\), called \(e\)'s epoch to
each step \(e\) such 
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) \leq t(e')\).

<p>
We will see that epochs have some of the properties of logical time
including the following:

<p class="w3-text-teal">Observation</p>
<i>There exists a computation in which steps are executed in
ascending order of epochs</i>.

<p>
This observation follows from the fact that there is a computation in
ascending order of
<a href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html">logical times.</a>

See <a href="">details</a>.

<p>
A consequence of this observation is that there is a computation
in which all steps with the same epoch, say \(T\), occur after all steps with
epochs less than \(T\) and before all steps with epochs greater than
\(T\).

The key idea of the algorithm is as follows:

  <hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
Each transaction is assigned a unique epoch, and all steps of a transaction are
assigned the epoch of the transaction.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

Next, we describe an algorithm based on this key idea.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Server</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

A server <code>q</code> has two local variables:
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>q.t</code>,
called <code>q</code>'s epoch,
which is the epoch of the transaction that <code>q</code> is
  processing.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>q.v</code> which is the value of the variable managed by
  <code>q</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Initially <code>q.v</code> is a symbol <code>None</code> to indicate
that no value has been assigned, and <code>q.t</code> is <code>0</code>.

<p>
A server receives two classes of messages: <code>ReadRequest</code> and
<code>WriteRequest</code>.
Every message, <code>m</code>, has a field, <code>m.t</code>, which is the
 epoch of the transaction in which <code>m</code> is sent.

A write request has a field, <code>v</code>, which is the value to be
written.

A server replies to a read request with a message of class
<code>Reply</code> which has two fields: <code>v</code>, the value of
the shared variable, and <code>t</code>, the epoch of the
message.

The algorithm is given below.

<pre>
# initialization
q.t, q.v = 0, None

start()
def receive(request, client):
   if request.t >= q.t
      q.t = request.t
      if isinstance(request, ReadRequest):
         send(Reply(q.v, q.t), client)
      else:
         // message is a WriteRequest
         q.v = request.v
</pre>


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Explanation of the Algorithm</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
A server rejects (ignores) requests from epochs earlier than the epoch
that the server is processing, i.e., a request is
rejected if <code>request.t < q.t</code>.

Rejected requests are treated as lost and don't appear in the
computation.

<p>
A server <code>q</code> is said to <i>accept</i> a request when
<code>request.t</code> \(\geq\) <code>q.t</code>.

The step in which <code>q</code> accepts a request with epoch
<code>T</code> is assigned epoch <code>T</code> because it is a step
in processing the transaction with epoch <code>T</code>.


<p>
If <code>request.t</code> \(=\) <code>q.t</code> then the server
continues to process the transaction in epoch <code>q.t</code>.

If <code>request.t</code> \(>\) <code>q.t</code> then the server
begins processing the transaction with epoch <code>request.t</code>, and
stops processing transactions from earlier epochs.

The server increases its transaction id to <code>request.t</code> to
indicate that it is now processing the transaction with epoch
<code>request.t</code>. 


<p>
A server <code>q</code> replies to each read request that it accepts and sets the
epoch of the reply to <code>q.t</code>.

A server <code>q</code> carries out a write transaction when <code>q</code>
accepts a write request.



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Client </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<p>
An epoch is a pair <code>(n, p)</code> where <code>p</code> is
the client that carries out the transaction and where <code>n</code> is
and  <code>p</code> are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total orders.</a>

Epochs are compared lexicographically.

Later transactions initiated by a client have higher epochs
than earlier transactions initiated by the same client.


<p>
Each client <code>p</code> has a local variable <code>p.t</code> 
which is the epoch of the transaction that <code>p</code>
is processing.

A client <code>p</code> has a local variable <code>p.copy</code> which
contains copies of shared variables.
<code>p.copy</code> is a dictionary and <code>p.copy[q]</code> is
<code>p</code>'s copy of the shared variable of server
<code>q</code>. 

<p>
The client's algorithm and explanation are given next.


<pre>
# Initialization
p.t = 0

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, ClockTick):
      # Start new transaction
      p.t = p.t + pos()
      p.copy = {}
      for q in Q:  send(ReadRequest(p.t), q)
   else:
      # message is a reply to a read request
      if message.t == p.t: 
         p.copy[sender] = message.v
         if len(p.copy) >= M:
            for q in Q:
               send(WriteRequest(v = p.f(), t=p.t), q)
</pre>



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Explanation of the Algorithm</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<p class="w3-text-teal">Receive a Clock Tick Message</p>
A client <code>p</code> starts executing a new transaction
 when it gets a clock tick message.


A client <code>p</code> sets the epoch <code>p.t</code> of the new
  transaction that it starts processing to
be a value greater than the epoch of the transaction that it was
  processing previously.

The client stops processing the transaction with an earlier epoch.

<p>
  <code>pos</code> is a function that returns a positive value.
  The value returned is not relevant to the
correctness of the algorithm but does impact performance.

<p>
  A client <code>p</code> discards earlier copies of shared variables and sends
read requests to each server.
The epoch of the
requests is <code>p.t</code>, the epoch of the transaction that
  <code>p</code> has started processing.


Client <code>p</code> then waits to receive a clock tick 
message and waits concurrently for replies to its read requests.

<!---------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Receive a Reply</p>
<!---------------------------------------------->

A client <code>p</code> accepts a <code>reply</code> if and only if
the reply is in the same epoch
as that of the transaction that <code>p</code> is processing.
i.e., <code>p.t</code> \(=\) <code>reply.t</code>.

Client <code>p</code> rejects replies from earlier transactions.

We will see that <code>p</code> never receives a reply from a
an epoch later than the transaction that <code>p</code> is processing.

<p>
Client <code>p</code> takes the following steps when it
accepts <code>reply</code> from a server,
<code>q</code>.
The client copies the value in the reply from <code>q</code> into the client's
local variable, <code>p.copy[q]</code>.

If <code>p</code> has received replies from <code>M</code> or more 
servers then <code>p</code> sends write requests to all servers.

The epoch of the write requests is <code>p.t</code>, the epoch of the
transaction that <code>p</code> is processing.

The value to be written, specified in the write request is
<code>p.f()</code>, a given function.



<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------->
Each transaction has a unique epoch because a client starts a
transaction with an epoch greater than epochs of 
earlier transactions that it starts.

Transactions started by different clients have different epochs
because an epoch is a pair <code>(n, p)</code> where <code>p</code> is
a client.

<p>
From the algorithm, all requests sent by clients, all requests accepted
by servers, all replies sent by servers, all replies accepted by
clients, and all steps in a transaction with epoch <code>T</code> have epoch
<code>T</code>.

The proof is straightforward and is given here.

Next we show that all steps of a transaction with epoch <code>T</code>
have epoch <code>T</code>.
And we show that all requests sent by clients, all requests accepted
by servers, all replies sent by servers, and all replies accepted by
clients in a transaction with epoch <code>T</code> have epoch
<code>T</code>. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">Client starts transaction with epoch
<code>T</code>.</p>

A client <code>p</code> starts a transaction  with epoch
<code>T</code>
by setting <code>p.t = T</code>, and
sending a read request <code>m</code> with <code>m.t = T</code> to each
server.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Server accepts a read request in epoch
<code>T</code> in a step in epoch <code>T</code>.</p>

The read request is treated as lost by a server <code>q</code> if
<code>T</code> \(<\) <code>q.t</code>.

If <code>T</code> \(\geq\) <code>q.t</code>, then the server accepts
the request and sets <code>q.t = T</code>, and
the server replies with a message in epoch <code>T</code>.
The accepted request, the step, and the reply have the same epoch
<code>T</code>. 

<p class="w3-text-teal">Client accepts a reply with epoch
<code>T</code> in a step in epoch <code>T</code>.</p>

A client <code>p</code> ignores a reply with epoch <code>T</code> if
the client is processing a transaction with a later epoch, i.e.,
(i.e. <code>T</code> \(<\) <code>p.T</code>).

A client <code>p</code> accepts a reply with epoch <code>T</code> only if the client is
processing the transaction with epoch <code>T</code> (i.e. <code>p.t =
T</code>).

Whe a client accepts a reply with epoch <code>T</code> the client
sends a write request with the same epoch.

The reply, the step, and the write request  have the same epoch
<code>T</code>.



<p class="w3-text-teal">Servers accepts a write request with epoch
<code>T</code> in a step in epoch <code>T</code>.</p>
The write request is treated as lost by a server <code>q</code> if
<code>T</code> \(<\) <code>q.t</code>.

If <code>T</code> \(\geq\) <code>q.t</code>, then the server accepts
the write request and sets <code>q.t = T</code>, and carries out the
write operation.

The request received and the step have the same epoch <code>T</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Messages between epochs</p>
The only message from an epoch to another is a clock tick message.

A clock tick is not part of the transaction.


<p>
Therefore, all requests and replies and steps in a transaction in
epoch <code>T</code> are in epoch <code>T</code>.


<!----------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Performance Issues</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------->

Each client is either executing a receive or is waiting to receive a
message.

Clients execute transactions concurrently; however, the algorithm
ensures that the dataflow represents a sequence of transaction
executions, one transaction at a time.


<p>
There may be computations with an infinite number of transactions in
which shared variables are never assigned values.

For example, requests may be lost, or there may fewer than
<code>M</code> replies to read requests.

<p>
Another scenario in which shared variables are never assigned values
is as follows.

Two transactions can collide with each other so that neither
transaction sends write requests.

For example, suppose clock ticks arrive every millisecond while
the time taken for a request to reach a server is 5 milliseconds.

In this case, clients start new transactions every millisecond
and never receive replies to any transaction.

So, the interval selected for clock ticks depends on the delays of
requests and replies.
