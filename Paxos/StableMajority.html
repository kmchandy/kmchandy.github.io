  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Paxos: Consensus in Faulty Systems</h2> 
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->

  <!-------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction</h3>
  <!-------------------------------------------------->

  
  Paxos is a consensus algorithm for systems in which messages may be lost; multiple
  copies of a message may be delivered; messages may not be
  delivered in the order sent; agents may be arbitrarily slow; and
  agents may stop.
  
  From
  <a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html">the
  FLP theorem</a>,
  
  there is no algorithm that guarantees that consensus among agents
  will be reached in such systems. 


  A consensus algorithm may not terminate; however,
  consensus is reached in most situations.

  <p>
  This webpage is a continuation of
  <a href="ReadWriteLossyChannels.hmtl">
  Serializable Computations in Faulty Systems</a>

  The description of the system and algorithm are summarized next.

  A distributed system has agents, called <i>clients</i> that send
  requests to agents, called <i>servers</i>, to read and
  write local variables of servers.

  Each server <code>q</code> has a local variable <code>q.v</code>
  which has two fields: <code>q.v.s</code>, the state of
  <code>q</code>, and <code>q.v.t</code>, the epoch in which
  <code>q.v</code> was last written.

  <p>
  In each transaction, a single client <code>p</code> sends requests
  to read <code>q.v</code> for all servers <code>q</code>, and 
  <code>p</code>  receives replies from some of the servers, and then sends
  requests to write <code>q.v</code> for all servers <code>q</code>.
  Though the system is faulty, and though multiple clients and servers
  execute concurrently, the collection of servers come to a consensus regarding
  a common value to be assigned to the servers' variables.


  <p>
  In this page, the state, <code>q.v.s</code>, of a server
  <code>q</code> is a sequence.

  An example of such a sequence is a ledger that keeps track of the
  sequence of transactions on a bank account.

A client gets the consensus value of the ledger and then proposes a
transaction that extends the ledger.

Servers come to a consensus about the extended ledger.

We call the sequence of values assigned to server variables a
<i>chain</i> of values, using a term from block chain algorithms.




  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

<p class="w3-text-teal">1. Every element of a consensus chain is
proposed by a client.</p>


<p>
If \(c\) is a consensus chain then for each \(i\), the extension of
the chain from \(c[0], \ldots, c[i-1]\) to \(c[0], \ldots, c[i-1],
c[i]\) is proposed by a client.


<p class="w3-text-teal">2. A consensus remains a consensus for ever.</p>

If \(c\) is a consensus chain at a point in a computation and 
\(c'\) is a consensus chain at a later point, then \(c\) is a prefix
of \(c'\), i.e., \(c\) is an initial subsequence of \(c'\).

<p>
For example, if \(c' = [a, b, c, d]\) and \(c\) has two elements then
\(c\) must be \([a, b]\).

  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Using the Algorithm for Serializing Transactions</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

We use the
<a href="ReadWriteLossyChannels.hmtl">
algorithm for serializing transactions</a> to reach a consensus.


<p>
We showed that 
  the timeline of each server <code>q</code> -- i.e., the sequence of
  values assigned to <code>q.v</code> -- is the same in each
  computation of the distributed algorithm as in an execution of the
  following nondeterministic sequential algorithm:

  
<pre>
while True:
   select a client p.
   select a subset R of M or more servers
   select a nonempty subset W 

   t = t + arbitrary positive value
   for q in W:
        q.v.s = p.f(q.v for q in R)
        q.v.t = t
</pre>


The selections of <code>p, R, W</code> and the increment to
<code>t</code> are nondeterministic.

<p>
Initially, <code>q.v.s = [init]</code> for all servers <code>q</code>
where <code>init</code> is a state common to all servers, and
<code>[init]</code> is a sequence consisting of the single element
<code>init</code>.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h3>
We use the sequential algorithm to implement the specification.

To solve the problem we need to (1) determine what a consensus is in the sequential
algorithm; (2) specify the value of <code>M</code> and (3) design the
function <code>p.f</code>. 


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach the Problem</h4>

<p class="w3-text-teal">How many replies before a client writes?</p>
What should <code>M</code> be?
A reasonable first guess is that a consensus among servers
requires at least a majority of servers to agree.

So, if <code>N</code> is the number of servers then <code>M =
int(N/2)+1</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">What is a consensus?</p>
When do servers reach a consensus?

Let's try the following definition.

<p>
<code>s*</code> is a consensus exactly when there exists a
majority <code>W</code> of servers and an epoch <code>t*</code> such
that:
<p>
for all <code>q</code> in <code>W</code>: <code>q.v.s, q.v.t =
v*, t*</code>

<p>
Servers are in a consensus <code>v.s, v.t = init, 0</code> in the
initial state.

Consensus values are written in iterations in which
<code>W</code> is a majority.


<p>
All that remains for us is to design function <code>p.f</code> and
then show that the algorithm is correct.


<p class="w3-text-teal">What should the client propose?</p>

The client proposes the value returned by the function <code>f</code>
which appears only in the line:
<pre>
q.v.s = p.f(q.v for q in R)
</pre>

The function has a single argument which is a list of <code>M</code>
elements.

Let's call this list <code>list_of_s_t</code> because element of the
list is a pair <code>s, t</code> where <code>s</code> is a state and
<code>t</code> is an epoch.

<p>
If all elements of the list are identical then each element of the
list is a consensus <code>v*, t*</code>, and so the client proposes an
extension to the consensus chain <code>v*</code>.

The servers come to a consensus about the extensions proposed by clients.

<p>
If not all elements of the list are identical then the client does not
extend the chain.

In this case, the client proposes a chain that has already been
proposed.

The client proposes the
element of <code>list_of_s_t</code> that was written in the most recent epoch.

<p>
The algorithm is given below.

<pre>
def f(list_of_s_t):
  if all elements of list_of_s_t are identical:
     # e is any element of list_of_s_t
     e = list_of_s_t[0]
     return e + propose_next_element(e)

  else:
     # propose y in list_of_s_t with largest epoch
     y = list_of_s_t[0]
     for x in list_of_s_t:
        if x.t > y.t: y = x
     return y.s
</pre>



  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
Part 1 of the specification follows directly from the algorithm
  because the only assignments to server variables occur when servers
implement write requests from clients.

Next,  we prove part 2. 

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h5>

Let <code>s*, t*</code> be any consensus in a computation.

If <code>q.v.t</code> \(\geq\) <code>t*</code> then <code>s*</code> is
a prefix of <code>q.v.s</code>.

<p>
Using the notation \(\leq\) for prefix, the theorem is: for all
servers <code>q</code>, and consensus <code>s*, t*</code>:
<p>
(<code>q.v.t</code> \(<\) <code>t*</code>) \(\; \vee \;\)
(<code>s*</code> \(\leq\) <code>q.v.s</code>)

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of the Theorem</h5>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case</p>

Consider the iteration in which the epoch is <code>t*</code>.

If <code>q.v</code> is modified in this iteration then
<code>q.v.s</code> \(=\) <code>s*</code>.

If <code>q.v</code> is not modified in this iteration then
<code>q.v.t</code> \(<\) <code>t*</code>.

So, the condition holds for <code>t = t*</code>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Induction Step</p>

Assume that the condition holds before an iteration with epoch
<code>T</code> where <code>T</code>
\(>\) <code>t*</code> and show that the condition
continues to hold when the iteration ends.

<p>
By the induction hypothesis, for all <code>s, t</code> in
<code>list_of_s_t</code>:
<p>
(<code>t</code> \(<\) <code>t*</code>) \(\; \vee \;\)
(<code>s*</code> \(\leq\) <code>s</code>).


<p>
There is a majority of servers <code>q</code> with <code>q.v.t =
t*</code> in the iteration with epoch <code>t*</code> because
<code>s*, t*</code> is a consensus.

Epochs do not decrease as iterations proceed.

Therefore for any epoch
<code>T</code> where <code>T</code> \(>\) <code>t*</code>,
there is a majority of servers <code>q</code>
with <code>q.v.t</code> \(\geq\) t*</code>, and from the induction hypothesis 
<code>s*</code> \(\leq\) <code>q.v.s</code>.


<p>
In each iteration, the set <code>R</code> of values that are read by a client is a
majority.

There is at least one element in common between any two majorities.

So, there exists at least one element <code>s, t</code> in
<code>list_of_s_t</code> such that <code>t</code> \(\geq\)
<code>t*</code>, and therefore <code>s*</code> \(\leq\)
<code>s</code>.

Therefore, function <code>f</code> either returns <code>s*</code> or
returns <code>s*</code> appended with a proposed next value.

So, the condition continues to hold at the end of the iteration.
