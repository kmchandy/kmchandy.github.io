<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h2>
Consider a system with 2 proposers P1 and P2 and 3 acceptors R1, R2,
    R3. Associated with each proposer P is a local variable P.v. This
    local variable is a color which is "red" for P1 and "blue" for
    P2. The system uses the Paxos algorithm by which a majority of
    acceptors come to a consensus about the colors of P1 and P2.
    <p>
    Write down a scenario by which acceptor R1 accepts (T, V) = (1,
    "red") and also accepts (T, V) = (2, "blue")

      Step A.1: Acceptors R1, R2 receive prepare(1) and reply with

      <li> 
    Step P.2: P1 receives promise(1, null, null) from 2 of the 3
    acceptors. So P1
      sends
      
      <br>propose(P.t, P.v) = propose(1, "red")
      
      <br>
      to all
    acceptors. This message reaches acceptor R1 but does not reach the
    other acceptors.

      <li>
    Step A.2: Acceptor R1 accepts (1, "red") and sends accept(1,
      "red") to all learners.

  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 2</h2>
  Is the following true? If a majority of acceptors accepts (T, V) and
  another majority of 
  acceptors accepts (T', V') then (T, V) = (T', V')?

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer to Question 2</h2>
  No, it's not true.

  <p>
  Here is a scenario for the system with 2 proposers and 3 acceptors
  described in question 1.
