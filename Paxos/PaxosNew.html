    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The Paxos Algorithm</h1>
    
<a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html"> From the
FLP theorem</a>, there is no algorithm that guarantees that consensus among
distributed agents will be reached if messages are delayed for
arbitrary time. Next we describe an algorithm,
<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
  <i>Paxos</i></a>, proposed by Lamport that deals with consensus.

  <p>
The description here uses different names for variables than Lamport's
  paper. Also, the proof given here is based on timelines and may
  appear different from the proof given in the original paper though
  the ideas are the same.

   
<p>
The Paxos algorithm deals with messages that may be lost and that may
overtake each other. Agents  may stop and restart later,
  and agents  may be arbitrarily slow.
   Messages are not modified while in transit and that agents
do not have <a href="../Byzantine/Byzantine.html">Byzantine
  faults.</a>
  
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h3>

<p>
The algorithm has agents called
<i>proposers</i> and others called <i>learners</i>. Proposers propose
  values and learners come to a consensus among
    the proposed values.

    <p>
Associated with each learner \(L\) is a local variable \(L.value\)
which is initially \(null\). Associated with each proposer \(P\) is a
local constant \(P.VALUE\) which is the value that the
proposer is proposing. The following invariants hold:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Learners learn only proposed values.
  <p>
  \(\forall L: \quad
  (L.value = null) \; \vee \;
  (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \: P : L.value = P.VALUE)
  \)
  </li>
  
  <li>
  A learner doesn't change a non-null value that it learns.
  <p>
  \(
  \forall L, V \neq null: \quad stable (L.value = V)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  All learners learn the same value.
  <p>
  \(
  \forall L, L': \quad
  (L.value = null) \vee (L'.value = null) \vee 
  ( L.value = L'.value)
  \)
  </li>
</ol>
The specification allows for the possibility that
consensus may never be reached --- \(L.value\) may remain
\(null\) forever for all \(L\).


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</h3>
The algorithm has an additional
layer of agents called <i>acceptors</i> in addition to proposers and
learners. The communication structure 
between agents is shown in the figure below. Proposers send and
receive messages from acceptors.

Learners receive messages from
acceptors, and do not send messages to proposers or
acceptors. We postpone discussion of learners, and begin by focusing
on interactions between proposers and acceptors.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local Variables</p>
In the description of the algorithm; a
<i>time</i> is a pair
  <code>(n, pid)</code>, where <code>pid</code>
    is the id
  of a proposer, and <code>n</code> and <code>pid</code> are integers
(or any total order).
A <i>value</i> is either <code>null</code> or
<code>P.VALUE</code> where <code>P</code> is a proposer.


We use symbols <code>P</code>, <code>A</code>,
<code>t</code> and <code>v</code> for proposer, acceptor, time and
value.

<p>
A proposer <code>P</code> has the following
local variables.
<ul>
<li>
  <code>P.t = [P.n, P.ID]</code> where <code>P.ID</code> is
  <code>P</code>'s id, and <code>P.n</code> is an integer.
Initially, <code>P.n = 0</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>P.V</code> is a constant and is <code>P</code>'s value.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An acceptor <code>A</code> has the following
local variables.
<ul>
  <li>
  <code>A.t</code>: The time at <code>A</code>. Initially <code>A.t =
  [0, null]</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.v</code>: The most recent value accepted by
  <code>A</code>. Initially <code>A.v = null</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.v_t</code>: The time at which <code>A</code> accepted
  <code>A.v</code>. Initially <code>A.v_t = [0, null]</code>. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Message Types</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <code>prepare(time)</code> from a proposer to all acceptors.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>promise(time, value, time)</code> reply to the proposer from
  an acceptor.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>accept(time, value)</code> from the proposer to
  all acceptors.
  </li>
</ul>
  

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Proposers and Acceptors</h4>
<pre>
// Proposer P. Step P.1. 
P.n = P.n + any positive value
P.t = [P.n, P.id]
send prepare(P.t) to all acceptors

// Acceptor A. Step A.1: 
upon arrival of prepare(t) at A from a proposer P:
   if t > A.t:
      A.t = t
      // receive arriving message
      send promise(t, A.v, A.v_t) to P

// Proposer P. Step P.2.
// only receive promise(t, -, -) messages where t = P.t

wait until timeout or:
     arrival of promise(t, A.v, A.v_t) from majority of
     acceptors where t = P.t
If timeout: return to step P.1
else:
     let promise(t, v*, v_t*) be the promise with
     the largest v_t where t = P.t
     if v* == NULL: send accept(t, P.V) to acceptors
     else: send accept(t, v*) to acceptors
      
// Acceptor A. Step A.2. 
upon arrival of accept(t, v):
    if t > A.t:
      A.t = t
      // receive the arriving message
      A.v = v
      send accepted(t, v) to all learners
</pre>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm Steps</h4>
The algorithm has only one point where an agent waits: step P.2
In this step a proposer <code>P</code> waits for a bounded time
to receive promise messages from a majority of acceptors
where the timestamp of each of these messages is <code>P.t</code>.
If these
messages don't arrive within this time then the proposer aborts this
iteration and starts the next iteration, i.e. back to step P.1,
without completing step P.2.
Note that the value of <code>P.t</code> in step P.2
is the same as its value at the end of step P.1.

<p>
A proposer repeatedly executes a loop consisting of steps P.1 and P.2.
For the time being assume that the loop never terminates.


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
The figure below shows events in a single epoch in a system timeline with 3 acceptors and 2
proposers. Timelines for learners are not shown. All events in the
same epoch have the same timestamps. We use T for this timestamp
common to all events in the epoch.

<p>
The legends for events in the diagram are: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>prep(t)</i>: A proposer <code>P</code> sends <code>prepare(T)</code> message, where
  <code>t</code> is the proposer's timestamp <code>P.t</code> at the
  point at which <code>P</code> sends the message, and <code>T =
  P.t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>prom(T, -, -)</i>: An acceptor <code>A</code> replies to the proposer with a
  <code>promise(T, accept_v, accept_t)</code> message, where
  <code>T</code> is the timestamp that <code>A</code> received in the
  <code>prepare(T)</code> message.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>accept(T, _)</i>: A proposer sends <code>accept(T, v)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A(t)</i>: An acceptor accepts
  <code>accept(T, v)</code> message in step A.2
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the diagram, <code>new_time</code> messages are grey,
<code>updated_time</code> messages are purple, and
<code>proposals</code> are black. The <code>new_time(t)</code> message
sent by proposer P0 to acceptor A2 is lost, and the the <code>proposal</code> sent
by P0 to acceptor A1 is lost.

    <figcaption>Fig.2: Timelines</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="w3-text-teal">Sync Times</p>
<code>P.t</code> and <code>A.t</code> are the <i>sync times of agents
<code>P</code> and <code>A</code></i>, respectively.
We call <code>A.accept_v</code> and <code>A.accept_t</code> the 
<i>value accepted</i> and the <i>sync time of the value accepted</i> by
<code>A</code>, respectively.
In messages <code>prepare(t)</code>, <code>promise(t, -, -)</code>, and 
<code>accept(t, -)</code>, <code>t</code> is the <i>sync time
of the message</i>.

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
Sync time property: The sync-time of a sender of a message
is the same as the sync-time of a receiver of that message.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

<p>Proof</p>
For every step of the algorithm:
the sync time of a message sent is the same as the sync time of the
sender at the point at which the message is sent, and
the sync time of a receiver of a message is the
same as the sync time of the message.

<p>
A consequence of the sync time property is the following.
Let \(X\) be the sequence of events in a given trajectory of the Paxos
algorithm. Let \(Y\) be a permutation of \(X\) where the timeline of
each agent is the same in \(X\) and \(Y\) and events in \(Y\) are executed in
increasing order of sync time. For all \(T\), the state of an agent when its sync
time is \(T\) is the same in \(X\) and \(Y\). Therefore we can reason
about agent states in \(X\) by reasoning about them in \(Y\).

<p>Partition the timeline of \(Y\) into
epochs where all events in an epoch have the same sync time.
We can analyze \(Y\) as a sequence of state transitions from the start
of an epoch to the start of the next epoch. Channels are empty at the
start of each epoch. So, these epoch-level state
transitions deal only with agent states.




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Synchronous trajectories</h4>
We prove that the synchronous trajectory Y satisfies the Paxos
specifications. 

<p>
Sync times are pairs (integer, process id). So, identical sync times
have the same process id. Therefore all sync times in an epoch
also have the same process id. From the algorithm, this process id is
the id of the proposer that sends the <code>prepare</code> message.
Therefore, all events in an epoch are a consequence of
<code>prepare</code> messages sent by the same proposer.

  
<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.008.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Example of epochs in a semi-synchronous trajectory</figcaption>
</figure>
The diagram shows a semi-synchronous trajectory with three epochs with
times \(t^{0}\), \(t^{1}\), and \(t^{2}\), shown
in brown, blue and green, respectively. All the events and messages in epoch
\(t^{i}\) have timestamp \(t^{i}\). In epochs \(t^{0}\) and \(t^{2}\)
the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P1, while in
epoch \(t^{1}\) the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P0.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{0}\), proposer P1 increases its time (see step P.1) to  \(t^{0}\)
  and sends \(prepare(t^{0})\) messages --- shown as brown arrows ---
  to acceptors. The message to acceptor A0 is lost. An acceptor \(A\)
  that gets the message replies with \(promise(t^{0},
  A.accept\_v, A.accept\_t)\). Proposer P1 waits to receive at least 2
  \(promise\) messages because 2 is a majority for a set of 3
  agents. When it receives the 2 messages, P1 sends  \(accept(t^{0},
  P1.v)\) messages to acceptors. In this diagram, the \(accept\)
  messages sent to A0 and A1 are lost while A2 receives the
  message which, in turn, sends \(accepted\) messages. In this epoch, a
  majority of acceptors do not send \(accepted\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{1}\), proposer P0 increases its time to  \(t^{1}\)
  and sends \(prepare(t^{1})\) messages
  to acceptors. P0 timesout waiting to receive
  \(promise\) messages from a majority of acceptors, and so it
  sends no \(accept\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{2}\), proposer P1 increases its time to  \(t^{2}\), and sends
  \(prepare(t^{2})\) messages. P1 receives
  \(promise\) messages from a majority of acceptors; sends
  proposals to acceptors; receives replies from a majority of
  acceptors, and then sends \(accept\) messages. The
  \(accept\) messages are received by a majority of acceptors, each
  of which sends \(accepted\) messages. So, learners that receive
  \(accepted\) messages from a majority of acceptors, set the values
  that they learned to the value in the \(accept\) messages.
  
  



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h3>
If a majority of acceptors accept the same value, \(V^{*}\) in an
epoch \(T^{*}\) of a semi-synchronous 
trajectory, then in all subsequent epochs:
<ol>
  <li>
    the value in all proposal and accept messages is \(V^{*}\), and
  </li>
  <li>
  for all acceptors \(A\):
    \( (A.accept\_t < T^{*}) \vee (A.accept\_v =  V^{*}) \)
		      </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h4>
The proof is by induction on successive epochs in the sequence of
epochs that follows epoch \(T^{*}\). Let \(T^{i}\) be the time of the
\(i\)-th epoch after epoch \(T^{*}\), and let \(T^{0} = T^{*}\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case: epoch \(T^{*}\)</p>
<i>Part 1</i>: All proposals are sent by the
same proposer in an epoch, and all proposals have the same timestamp
and value. Therefore, the value in all proposal and accept messages in
epoch \(T^{*}\) is \(V^{*}\).

<p>
<i>Part 2</i>:  In epoch \(T^{*}\), \(A.accept\_t\) is changed only when 
\(A.accept\_v\) is set to \(V^{*}\), and so part 2 follows.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Induction step: epoch \(T^{i+1}\)</p>
Assume that the theorem holds for epochs \(T^{0}, T^{1}, \ldots,
T^{i}\), and prove that it holds for epoch \(T^{i+1}\).
The result is vacuously true if no proposals are sent in
   this epoch. Consider the case where proposals are sent.

   <p>
     Because  \(A.accept\_t\) is never decreased, it follows
     that in all epochs after epoch \(T^{*}\) there is a majority of
     acceptors for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). 
   <p>
     A proposer \(p\) sends a proposal only if it receives
     \(updated\_time\) messages from a majority of acceptors. Any two
     majorities have at least one element in common. So, there exists
     an acceptor \(A\) that sends an \(updated\_time\) message to
     \(p\) and for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). Because
     \(A.accept\_t\) is positive, \(A.accept\_v\) 
     is not null (see the invariants).

   <p>
     So, proposer \(p\) identifies the \(updated\_time\) message with
     the largest \(A.accept\_t\). This value is greater than or equal
     to \(T^{*}\), and so the corresponding \(A.accept\_v \) is
     \(V^{*}\), and therefore the  proposal's value is
     \(V^{*}\). So, the value of accept messages is also \(V^{*}\),
     and if \(A.accept\_v\) is changed then the new value is \(V^{*}\).


     <h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
     This example illustrates the idea underlying the proof. In the
     next diagram, proposer P0 sends a \(new\_time(T^{*})\)
     message which is received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond
     with updated time messages with timestamp \(T^{*}\). Proposer P0
     receives both messages, and sends proposals to all acceptors. In
     this case the proposals are received by A0 and A2 which then send
     accept messages. When A0 and A2 receive the proposals they set
     \(A.accept\_t, A.accept\_v = T^{*}, V^{*}\), and these values
     remain unchanged until the next proposal is received. 
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.009.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:60%">
    <figcaption>Fig.7: Idea underlying the proof</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram below shows an epoch T1 that follows epoch T0. In this
epoch, proposer P1 sends \(new\_time(T^{1})\) messages which are
received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond with updated time
messages with timestamp \(T^{1}\).
When P1 gets both messages it sends proposals to all acceptors.
Let's use the argument of the proof
to determine the value of proposals and the accept message sent by A1 in this
epoch. 


<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.010.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:60%">
    <figcaption>Fig.8: What can be proved about the next accept message?</figcaption>
</figure>


When P1 gets both updated time messages it
identifies the message with the largest value of \(A.accept\_t\). The
message sent by A0 has timestamp \(T^{*}\) whereas the message sent by
A1 has an earlier timestamp. So, the updated time message with the
largest \(A.accept\_t\) is the message sent by A0. 

P1 sends proposals with a value of
\(A0.accept\_t\) which is \(V^{*}\). The green circles show how the
value \(V^{*}\) is sent from A0 to P1 to A1.

   <p>
     We see that proposals and accept
messages have value \(V^{*}\) in the next epoch as well.

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct for
  Semi-Synchronous Trajectories</h3>
The specification of the algorithm is repeated here for convenience.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A learner doesn't change the value that it learns.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

   <p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
   The value of
<code>v</code> in every message is either null or <code>P.VALUE</code>
for some proposer P, and so part 1 follows. Parts 2 and 3 follow from
the previous theorem: if a majority of acceptors send identical
 \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) messages in an epoch, then in all succeeding
epochs, the value \(v\) of every accept message remains \(V^{*}\).


<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Paxos is Correct for
  all Trajectories</h3>

We have shown that the Paxos algorithm is correct for semi-synchronous
trajectories. Now we show the correctness of the algorithm for all
trajectories.

Let \([past(T), future(T)]\) be a cut of a timeline where \(past(T)\)
is the set of events with time \(T\) or
less. Therefore \(future(T)\) is the set of events with time greater than \(T\).

<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Consistent cuts</h4>
The cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) is consistent.

<h5  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
There is no message from an event in \(future(T)\)
to an event in \(past(T)\).

<p>
  If a proposer sends a message in the future, i.e., with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor processes the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\), and is also in the future.
      Likewise, if a proposer sends a message with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor receives the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\).

<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.018.jpeg" alt="Fig8" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.8: Consistent Cuts of Paxos Trajectories</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram shows a cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) of a trajectory. The
green circles represent events in the past, and the yellow circles
represent events in the future. A little analysis shows that there are
no edges from the future to the past. (Indeed, you can show that there
are no edges from the past to the future, and so the graph can be
partitioned into independent subgraphs.)

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct</h3>
Consider any trajectory \(X\) in which a majority of acceptors accepts \((T^{*},
V^{*})\). Let \(Y\) be the semi-synchronous trajectory corresponding
to X.

From the theorem on semi-synchronous trajectories, for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(Y\) with \(T' \geq T\) have \(V' =
V^{*}\).
Because the global states are identical in \(X\) and \(Y\), for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(X\) with \(T' \geq T\) also have \(V' =
V^{*}\). Therefore if a learner receives \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) from a
majority of acceptors, and the same or another learner receives \(accept(T', V')\) from a
majority of acceptors, then \(V' = V^{*}\) and the correctness of parts 2 and 3 of the
specification follow.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Learners</h4>
The algorithm for learners is simple:
A learner determines that the consensus value is <code>V</code> if the
learner receives <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages from a majority of
acceptors with identical values of <code>(T, V)</code>.
We ignore learners in the algorithm description, and restrict
attention to whether and when a majority of
acceptors sends <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages with identical
values of <code>(T, V)</code>.
