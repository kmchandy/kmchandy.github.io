  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-red">
  In this webpage we develop algorithms for systems in which agents
  may halt or be arbitrarily slow; the same message may be
  delivered multiple times and delivered out of order; and, messages
  may be lost.

  A transaction consists of two steps: a client reads and the writes
  shared variables.

  This page shows how a proxy for time can be used to develop
  algorithms in which computations can be serialized -- for every
  computation \(x\)  there exists a computation \(y\)
  with the same steps as \(x\) and in which all steps of a transaction
  appear consecutively.

 

  
  
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Overview</h3>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  In this page we develop algorithms for systems in which messages may
  be lost; multiple 
  copies of a message may be delivered; messages may not be
  delivered in the order sent; agents may be arbitrarily slow; and
  agents may stop.

  <p>
  A system consists of a set of agents called <i>clients</i> and a
  set of agents called <i>servers</i>.

  There is a channel from each server to each client, and from each
  client to each server.

  There are no other channels.
  
  <p>
  Clients execute transactions in which they send requests to servers
  to read and then write variables managed by servers.

  We describe algorithms in which computations are serializable:
  For every computation \(x\) there exists a computation \(y\)
  with the same steps as \(x\) and where
  steps of each transaction appear consecutively in \(y\). 




  
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Servers</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
Each server <code>q</code> has a local variable <code>q.v</code>.

Clients send requests to <code>q</code> to read or write
<code>q.v</code>.

The only actions of a server are to respond to requests from clients.


<p>
A server <code>q</code> replies to a read request from a client
<code>p</code> by sending <code>p</code> a copy of <code>q.v</code>.

A write request includes the value <code>v</code> to be
written.

When a server <code>q</code> receives a write request containing value
<code>v</code>, the server assigns <code>v</code> to <code>q.v</code>.



<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Clients</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

Each client receives a sequence of <i>clock tick</i> messages.

The intervals between successive clock ticks are irrelevant for
the correctness of the algorithm.

The intervals do, however, impact performance.

There are many ways of generating sequences of messages and we
postpone discussion of them.

<p>
A read request and reply may get lost or be delayed for an arbitrary
time. 

A client avoids waiting forever for a reply from a server by only
accepting replies that the client receives before it receives its next
clock tick message.

Replies that arrive after the next clock tick are treated as lost.


<!----------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Read Step of a Transaction</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------->


A client <code>p</code> sends read requests to all servers.

Some requests may be lost.

A server that receives a read request from <code>p</code> sends a
reply to <code>p</code>.

Some replies may be lost.

Let <code>R</code> be the set of servers from which  <code>p</code>
receives replies before  <code>p</code> receives its next clock tick.



<p>

If <code>R</code> has <code>M</code> or more elements, where
<code>M</code> is a given constant, then  <code>p</code> proceeds to the
write step.

If <code>R</code> has fewer than <code>M</code> elements, then the
transaction terminates without executing the write step.


<!---------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Write Step of a Transaction</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------->


<p>
The list of replies that <code>p</code> gets before <code>p</code>
receives its next clock tick is:
<code>
[q.v for q in R]
</code>.
The value that a client requests servers to write in a transaction
depends only on the client's local variables and the values it
receives from servers in the read step of the transaction.

Client <code>p</code> 
sends a request to all servers to write:
<code>
p.f(q.v for q in R)
</code>
where <code>p.f</code> is a function of <code>p</code>.


<p>
Write requests may get lost.

Let <code>W</code> be the set of servers that execute write requests.

A transaction is specified by the following statement:

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">Transaction</h5>
<pre>
if len(R) >= M:
   for q in W: q.v = p.f(q.v for q in R)
</pre>
<hr class="new2">


Transactions executed concurrently by multiple clients can interfere
with each other as illustrated by the following example.

<!---------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------->

  Let <code>x</code> be the amount of funds in an account and 
  assume that <code>x</code> has $110.
  
  Consider a computation in which clients <code>p</code> and
<code>p'</code> both execute identical transactions concurrently.

In a transaction a client reads <code>x</code> and if
  <code>x</code> has at least $100 then the client transfers $100 out
of  <code>x</code> to an account <code>y</code>.

<p>
Consider a computation in which both clients
read <code>x</code> and verify that <code>x</code> has at least $100,
and then both clients transfer $100 out of <code>x</code> and set the amount
  in <code>x</code> to $10.

The computation transfers $200 out of <code>x</code> but 
debits <code>x</code> by $100.


<p>
This situation does not occur if only one client executes a
transaction at a time.

If <code>p</code> executes its transaction first then when
<code>p</code> completes the transaction it sets the amount in <code>x</code> to $10. 
If <code>p'</code> executes its transaction next then <code>p'</code>
finds that <code>x</code> has only $10 and so <code>p'</code> does not
transfer $100 from <code>x</code>.





<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Serializable Computations</h3>
<!---------------------------------------------------->

  A computation \(x\) is 
  <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">
  serializable</a> exactly when there exists a
  computation \(y\) which
  is a permutation of \(x\)  and in which: <i>All steps
  of each transaction appear consecutively</i>. 

<p>
Computation \(x\) may
have steps from a transaction \(u\) followed by steps from a different
transaction \(v\) followed by more steps from \(u\).

By contrast, in \(y\) either (1) all steps of transaction \(u\) appear
before all steps of 
transaction \(v\) or (2) all steps of transaction \(u\) appear after all
steps of 
transaction \(v\).



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Problem: Design Algorithms with
Serializable Computations</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
The problem is to develop a distributed algorithm, with multiple
clients and servers, in which computations are serializable, and in
which the system may be faulty.

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve The Problem?</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

What method comes to mind to partition a computation into sequences
where each sequence has all the steps of exactly one transaction?

<p>
Logical time partitions computations into a past and a future.

Let's use a mechanism, similar to logical time,
that partition steps into past, <i>current</i>, and future, 
where <i>current consists of all the steps of exactly one
transaction.</i> 

We call the value assigned to a step the <i>epoch</i> of the
step in analogy to the logical time of the step.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Epochs and Logical Times</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<p>
The logical time of a step \(e\) is a value \(t(e)\) assigned to
each step \(e\) in a computation such 
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) < t(e')\).

<p>
The <i>epoch</i> of a step \(e\) is a value \(t(e)\) assigned to
each step \(e\) in a computation such 
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) \leq t(e')\).

<p>
Epochs are implemented using rules similar to rules
for logical time:
(1)
  Later steps at an agent have the same or higher epochs than earlier
  steps at the agent.
(2)
  A message is received in a step with the same or higher epoch
  time than the step in which the message is sent.


<p>
Epochs have many of the properties of logical time
including the following:


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h3>
Given any assignment of epochs to steps:
<p>
<i>There exists a computation in which steps are executed in
ascending order of epochs</i>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The proof of this observation is the same as that for
<a href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html">logical times:</a>
There exists a topological sort of a dataflow graph where vertices in
the sort occur in ascending order of epoch.

<p>
A consequence of this observation is the following sufficient
condition for serializability.


<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
A sufficient conditions for serializability is:

<p style="color:blue;">
(1) each transaction has a unique epoch, and (2) all steps in a
transaction have the epoch of the transaction.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

Next, we describe an algorithm based on this idea.

Let's consider the two issues posed by the condition for serializability.

(1) How can the algorithm assign a unique epoch to each transaction?

(2) How can the algorithm assign epochs to steps so that
all steps in a transaction have the epoch of the transaction?



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Uniqueness of a Transaction's Epoch</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------>


A client <code>p</code> initiates a new transaction when
<code>p</code> gets a clock tick message.

To ensure that the epoch of the transaction is unique, an  epoch
<code>t</code> is a pair <code>(n, p_id)</code> where <code>n</code> is a
number and <code>p_id</code> is the id of client <code>p</code>.

Transactions initiated by different clients have different epochs
because their client ids are different.

A client sets the epoch of a new transaction that it initiates to be
greater than epochs of all previous transactions that it initiated.

So, different transactions initiated by the same client have different
epochs.

Therefore each epoch is unique.

<p>
Client ids are totally ordered, and so epochs are also totally
ordered.

For brevity we refer to an epoch by a single value <code>t</code> rather than a
pair <code>(n, p_id)</code>.



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">All Steps in a Transaction have the
Transaction's Epoch</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

We associate a field <code>t</code> with each agent -- client or
server -- where
<code>t</code> is the epoch of the transaction that the agent is
executing.

Likewise, we associate a field <code>t</code>
with each message -- request or reply -- between clients and servers
where 
<code>t</code> is the epoch of the transaction in which the message is
sent.

We refer to these fields as the agent's or client's epochs.


<p>
Next we consider steps executed by clients and servers in a
transaction with an epoch \(T\). 


<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">All Steps Executed by A Client in a
Transaction have the Transaction's Epoch</h6>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Client <code>p</code> initiates a new
transaction</p>

When a client <code>p</code> gets a clock tick message it executes
<pre>
p.t = p.t + pos()
</pre>
where <code>pos</code> returns a positive value.

Then <code>p</code>
initiates a new transaction with epoch <code>p.t</code>.

<code>p.t</code> remains unchanged until <code>p</code> gets its next
clock tick message.

Next, consider steps executed by the transaction with epoch <code>T</code>
where <code>T</code> is the value that <code>p.t</code> has until
<code>p</code> gets its next clock tick message.

All steps executed by <code>p</code> while <code>p.t</code> \(=\)
<code>T</code> belong to the transaction with epoch <code>T</code>. 



<p class="w3-text-teal">Client <code>p</code> sends requests </p>
Every message <code>m</code> sent between clients and servers has a field
<code>m.t</code> called <code>m</code>'s epoch.

When a client <code>p</code> sends a request <code>m</code> it sets 
<code>m.t</code> to <code>p.t</code>.

So, all requests sent by a client <code>p</code> while <code>p</code>
is executing steps of the transaction with epoch <code>T</code> also
have epoch <code>T</code>.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Client <code>p</code> receives a reply </p>
A server sends a reply  <code>r</code> with epoch  <code>r.t</code>,
where <code>r.t</code> \(=\) <code>T</code>,
when the server is executing the transaction with epoch
<code>T</code>. 

A client <code>p</code> which is executing the transaction with
epoch <code>T</code> takes no action when it receives a reply sent in
a different transaction, i.e., <code>p</code> discards a reply
<code>r</code>, without 
taking any action, when <code>r.t</code> \(\neq\)
<code>p.t</code>.

<p>

When a client <code>p</code> receives a reply <code>r</code> it
takes a next step if and only if <code>r.t</code> \(=\)
<code>p.t</code>.

So, a client <code>p</code> executing a transaction with epoch
<code>T</code> only accepts replies sent in the transaction with epoch
<code>T</code>.


Therefore, while a client <code>p</code> is
executing a transaction with epoch <code>T</code>:
all steps executed by the client, all requests it sends, and all
replies it accepts, also have epoch <code>T</code>.



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">All Steps Executed by A Server in a
Transaction have the Transaction's Epoch</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
Let's look at three cases: What actions should a server take when it
receives a request from (1) an earlier epoch, (2) the same epoch, and
(3) a later epoch?

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Case 1: Server receives a request from an earlier epoch</h6>
A server <code>q</code> takes no action when it receives a request
<code>m</code> from an earlier epoch, i.e. when
<p>
<code>m.t</code> \(<\) <code>q.t</code>.
<p>
Such requests are treated as lost.

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Case 2: Server receives a request in the same epoch</h6>
A server takes the action specified in a request that has the same epoch
as the server's epoch.
<p>
When a server <code>q</code> receives a read request
<code>m</code> where <code>m.t</code> \(=\) <code>q.t</code>, the
server replies with a message <code>r</code> with two fields
<code>r.v</code> and <code>r.t</code> where
<code>r.v = q.v</code> 
and <code>r.t = q.t</code>.

So, the request, the step in which the request is processed, and the
reply, all have the same epoch.

<p>
A write request <code>m</code> has two fields: <code>m.v</code> the
value to be written, and <code>m.t</code> the epoch of the message.
When a server <code>q</code> receives a write request
<code>m</code> where <code>m.t</code> \(=\) <code>q.t</code>, the
server writes the specified value, i.e. executes <code>q.v =
m.v</code>.

So, the write request and the step in which the request is processed
have the same epoch.


<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Case 3: Server receives a request from a later
epoch</h6>

What should server <code>q</code> do when it receives a request
<code>m</code> where <code>m.t</code> \(>\) <code>q.t</code>?

<p>
Can the server ignore the request?

No, the server cannot ignore the request because
if it does then the server's epoch never
changes.


<p>
So, in this case, a server <code>q</code> increases its epoch to that
of the request <code>m</code> -- i.e. assigns <code>q.t = m.t</code>
--  and responds to the request as described in Case 2.

<p>
Next, we give the algorithm based on this discussion.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Variables</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
A server <code>q</code> has local variables <code>q.v</code> and
<code>q.t</code> where <code>q.v</code> is the value of the server,
and <code>q.t</code> is the server's epoch. 

<p>
A client <code>p</code> has a local variable <code>p.copy</code> which
contains copies of servers' variables.
<code>p.copy</code> is a dictionary and <code>p.copy[q]</code> is
<code>p</code>'s (possibly stale) copy of <code>q.v</code>.

A client <code>p</code> also has a local variable  <code>p.t</code>
which is the client's epoch.




<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Messages</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<p>
A server receives two classes of messages from clients: <code>ReadRequest</code> and
<code>WriteRequest</code>.

A <code>ReadRequest</code> message has a single field <code>t</code>
which is the epoch of the message.

A <code>WriteRequest</code> message has fields <code>v, t</code>
where <code>v</code> is the value to be written and <code>t</code> is
the epoch of the message. 


<p>
A client receives two classes of messages: <code>ClockTick</code> and
<code>Reply</code>.

A <code>ClockTick</code> message has no fields.

A <code>Reply</code> message has fields <code>v, t</code>
where <code>v</code> is the value that was read by the server
and <code>t</code> is the epoch of the message. 



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Server</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<pre>
# initialization
q.v, q.t = init, 0

start()
def receive(request, client):
   if request.t >= q.t
      q.t = request.t
      if isinstance(request, ReadRequest):
         send(Reply(q.v, q.t), client)
      else:
         // message is a WriteRequest
         q.v = request.v
</pre>

Next we give the algorithm for a client and explain statements in the
algorithm later.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Client </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<pre>
# Initialization
p.t = 0

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, ClockTick):
      p.t = p.t + pos()
      # Start new transaction with epoch p.t
      p.copy = {}
      for q in Q:  send(ReadRequest(p.t), q)

   else:
      # message is a reply to a read request
      if message.t == p.t: 
         p.copy[sender] = message.v
         # send writes if at least M replies received
         if len(p.copy) >= M:
            v, t = p.f(), p.t
            for q in Q: send(WriteRequest(v, t), q)
</pre>



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Explanation of the Algorithm</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->



<p class="w3-text-teal">When a Client Receives a Clock Tick
Message</p>

A client <code>p</code> increases its epoch by some positive value
<code>pos</code>  and starts a new transaction with epoch
<code>p.t</code>. 

  Client <code>p</code> discards earlier copies of server variables by
setting <code>p.copy</code> to empty.
The client then sends read requests to each server.
The client then waits to receive a clock tick 
message and waits concurrently for replies to its read requests.

<!---------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">When a Client Receives a Reply</p>
<!---------------------------------------------->

A client <code>p</code> accepts a <code>reply</code> if 
the reply is in the same epoch
as that of the transaction that <code>p</code> is processing.
i.e., <code>p.t</code> \(=\) <code>reply.t</code>.


Client <code>p</code> copies the value in the reply from
<code>q</code> into the client's 
local variable, <code>p.copy[q]</code>.

If <code>p</code> has received replies from <code>M</code> or more 
servers then <code>p</code> sends write requests to all servers.

A write request contains the value <code>p.f()</code> to be written
and the epoch <code>p.t</code> of the request.



<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Let \(x\) be a computation of the distributed algorithm.

Let the epochs of transactions in \(x\), in increasing order of epochs
be <code>T[0]</code> \(<\) <code>T[1]</code> \(<\) <code>T[0]</code>
\(< \ldots \) <code>T[K]</code> where <code>K</code> is the number of
transactions in \(x\).

<p>
From the arguments given earlier, there exists a computation \(y\)
where \(y\) is a permutation of \(x\) and where steps of the
transaction with epoch <code>T[i]</code> appear in \(y\) after all steps of
transactions with epoch  <code>T[i-1]</code>, all <code>i</code>.


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Equivalence of Sequential Iterations</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------->
Let <code>p[i]</code> be the client that initiates the
<code>i</code>-th transaction, <code>R[i]</code> be the set of servers
from which <code>p[i]</code> receives replies, and <code>W[i]</code>
the set of servers that receive write requests from <code>p[i]</code>
in the transaction.

The sequence of values of server variables in computation
\(y\) are the same as that in the following iterations:

<pre>
for k = 0 to K:
   if len(R[i]) > M:
      for q in W[i]: q.v = p.f(q.v for q in R[i])
</pre>


<!------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Next</h3>

Next we develop Paxos, a distributed consensus algorithm.
We prove
that Paxos satisfies the specifications for consensus by showing that
Paxos is serializable.
We prove properties of a nondeterministic sequential algorithm and
show that properties of the sequential algorithm also hold for Paxos.
