  In this webpage we develop algorithms for systems in which: Agents
  may halt or be arbitrarily slow; the same message may be
  delivered multiple times;
  messages may be delivered out of order; and messages
  may be lost.

  A transaction consists of two steps: a client (1) reads and (2) then writes
  shared variables.

  This page shows how a proxy for time can be used to develop
  algorithms in which computations can be serialized: Each agent
  starts and completes a transaction before executing steps of another
  transaction. 

 

  
  
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Overview</h3>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
  In this webpage we develop algorithms for systems in which: Agents
  may halt or be arbitrarily slow, the same message may be
  delivered multiple times,
  messages may be delivered out of order, and messages
  may be lost.

  <p>
  A system consists of a set of agents called <i>clients</i> and a
  set of agents called <i>servers</i>.

  There is a channel from each server to each client, and from each
  client to each server.

  <p>
  Clients execute transactions in which they send requests to servers
  to read and then write variables managed by servers.

  We describe an algorithm in which computations are serializable
  which allows us to treat the sequences of steps at each agent as
  though exactly one transaction is executed at a time.




  
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Servers</h5>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
  
Each server <code>q</code> has a variable <code>q.v</code>.

Clients send requests to <code>q</code> to read or write
<code>q.v</code>.

The only actions of a server are to respond to requests from clients.


<p>
A server <code>q</code> replies to a read request from a client
<code>p</code> by sending <code>p</code> a copy of <code>q.v</code>.

A write request includes the value <code>v</code> to be
written.

A server <code>q</code> assigns <code>v</code> to <code>q.v</code>
when <code>q</code> receives a write request containing value
<code>v</code>.



<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Clients</h5>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

Each client receives a sequence of <i>clock tick</i> messages.

The intervals between successive clock ticks are irrelevant for
the correctness of the algorithm.

The intervals do, however, impact performance.

There are many ways of generating clock tick messages and we
postpone a discussion of them.

<p>
A read request and a reply to the request may get lost or be delayed for an arbitrary
time. 

A client avoids waiting forever for a reply by only
accepting replies that the client receives before it receives its next
clock tick message.

Replies that arrive after the next clock tick are treated as lost.

<p>
A transaction consists of a read step and a write step.
<!----------------------------------------------------->
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Read Step of a Transaction</h6>
<!----------------------------------------------------->


A client <code>p</code> sends read requests to all servers.

Some requests may be lost.

A server that receives a read request from <code>p</code> sends a
reply to <code>p</code>.

Some replies may be lost.

Let <code>R</code> be the set of servers from which  <code>p</code>
receives replies before  <code>p</code> receives its next clock tick.



<p>

If <code>R</code> has <code>M</code> or more elements, where
<code>M</code> is a given constant, then  <code>p</code> proceeds to the
write step.

If <code>R</code> has fewer than <code>M</code> elements, then the
transaction terminates without executing the write step.


<!---------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Write Step of a Transaction</h5>
<!----------------------------------------------------->


<p>
The list of replies that <code>p</code> gets before <code>p</code>
receives its next clock tick is:
<pre>
[q.v for q in R]
</pre>

Client <code>p</code> sends a request to all servers to write:
<code>
p.f(q.v for q in R)
</code>
where <code>p.f</code> is a function of <code>p</code>.


<p>
Write requests may get lost.

Let <code>W</code> be the set of servers that receive write requests.

<p>
A transaction consists of: (1) the step in which a client <code>p</code>
broadcasts read requests to all servers, (2) the steps in which servers
receive read requests and send replies, (3) the steps in which
<code>p</code> receives replies, (4) if <code>p</code> sends write
requests, then the step in which <code>p</code>
sends write requests, and (5) the steps in which servers
receive and execute write requests.

<p>
Changes to server variables in a transaction are specified by the
following statement in which <code>p.f</code> is a function executed
by <code>p</code>.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">Transaction executed by a client
<code>p</code></h5> 
<pre>
# R is the set of servers from which p receives
# replies to read requests
if len(R) >= M:
   for q in W: q.v = p.f(q.v for q in R)
</pre>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
The parameters of the transaction are the number
<code>M</code> and the function <code>p.f</code>.

The selections of <code>R</code> and <code>W</code> are
nondeterministic and they can be arbitrary sets of servers.

<p>
Transactions executed concurrently by multiple clients can interfere
with each other as illustrated by the following example.

<!---------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------->

  Let <code>x</code> be the amount of funds in an account and 
  assume that <code>x</code> has $110.
  
  Consider a computation in which clients <code>p</code> and
<code>p'</code> both execute identical transactions concurrently.

In a transaction a client reads <code>x</code> and if
  <code>x</code> is at least $100 then the client transfers $100 from
<code>x</code> to an account <code>y</code>.

<p>
Consider a computation in which both clients <code>p</code> and <code>p'</code>
read <code>x</code> and verify that <code>x</code> is at least $100,
and then both clients transfer $100 out of <code>x</code> and both
clients set the amount in <code>x</code> to $10.

The computation transfers $200 out of <code>x</code> but 
debits <code>x</code> by only $100.


<p>
This situation does not occur if only one client executes a
transaction at a time.

If <code>p</code> executes its transaction first then when
<code>p</code> completes the transaction it sets the amount in <code>x</code> to $10. 
If <code>p'</code> executes its transaction next then <code>p'</code>
finds that <code>x</code> is only $10 and so <code>p'</code> does not
transfer $100 from <code>x</code>.

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
  A computation \(x\) is <i>serializable</i> exactly when:
<p style="color:blue;">
There exists a
sequence of transactions \(Z_{i}, i \geq 0\), such that in  \(x\):
<p style="color:blue;">
For all agents \(v\), for all \(j\), and all \(i < j\), and all \(k > j\):
<center>
<p style="color:blue;">
All steps of \(v\) in \(Z_{j}\) occur after all steps of \(v\) in
\(Z_{i}\), and before all steps of \(v\) in \(Z_{k}\).
</center>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
The definition of serializability allows for the possibility that a
computation is serializable with a sequence of transactions \(Z_{i}, i
\geq 0\), where the computation has a step of transaction
\(Z_{1}\) followed by a step of transaction \(Z_{0}\) followed by
another step of transaction \(Z_{1}\).
An example of this situation is where an agent \(u\) has steps in
transaction \(Z_{1}\) and no steps in transaction \(Z_{0}\).

<p>
A computation is not serializable if the same agent executes a step in
a transaction \(X\) and then executes a step in a different
transaction \(Y\) and then executes another step in transaction \(X\). 
<!---------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Transactions and Serializability in
Databases</p>

There is an extensive literature on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction_schedule">
transactions and serializability.</a>
Also see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing_system">
transaction processing systems</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">
online transaction processing</a>.
In this webpage we provide a narrow definition of transactions and
serializability
that is adequate for describing consensus algorithms such as
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem: Guarantee Serializability</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
The problem is to develop a distributed algorithm, with multiple
clients and servers, in which computations are serializable, and in
which systems may be faulty.

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Solve The Problem?</h5>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

What method comes to mind to partition the sequence of steps of a
computation into intervals such that all agents complete all steps of
the same transaction in each interval?

<p>
The logical time at \(t\) partitions steps of a computation into a cut
specified by the <code>past</code> at \(t\) and the <code>future</code> at
\(t\). 

Let's use a mechanism, similar to logical time.

<p>
As with logical time, each step \(e\) in a computation is assigned a
value \(t(e)\), called the  <i>epoch</i> of \(e\).
For any step \(e\), steps with epochs less than, equal to, or greater
than, \(t(e)\) are in the <code>past</code> at \(t\),
<i>current</i> at \(t\), and <code>future</code> at \(t\)
respectively.

<p>
We specify epochs such that:
<hr class="new2">
<center>
<p style="color:blue;">
Steps with the same epoch are steps of exactly one
transaction.
</center>
<hr class="new2">



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Epochs and Logical Times</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Recall that
<a href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html">the logical time</a>
of a step \(e\) is a value \(t(e)\) assigned to
each step \(e\) in a computation such 
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) < t(e')\).


The <i>epoch</i> of a step \(e\) in a computation is defined as a
value \(t(e)\) assigned to 
each step \(e\) in the computation such 
that for all edges \((e, e')\) of the dataflow graph:
\(t(e) \leq t(e')\).

<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Rules for Assigning Epochs to Steps</h6>
The following rules ensure that the assignment \(t(e)\) to each step
\(e\) in a computation satisfies the specification for epochs. For all
steps \((e, e')\) of a computation
<ol>
  <li>
  for all steps \(e\) and \(e'\) at the same agent: if \(e'\) occurs
  after \(e\) then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\), and
  </li>
  <li>
  if \(e\) is a step in which a message is sent and \(e'\) is a step
  in which that message is received then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
  </li>
</ol>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Observation</h6>
If \(e\) and \(e'\) are steps at the same agent and \(t(e) < t(e')\)
then \(e'\) occurs after \(e\). 



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: A Sufficent Condition for Serializability</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
A sufficient conditions for a computation to be serializable is:

<p style="color:blue;">
There exists epochs for all steps of a computation such that
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  each transaction has a unique epoch, and
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="color:blue;">
  all steps in a transaction have the epoch of the transaction.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
If a computation \(x\) satisfies this condition then 
let the epochs of transactions in \(x\) be \([T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots]\)
where \(T_{i} < T_{i+1}\), and let \(Z_{i}\) be the transaction with
epoch \(T_{i}\).
Then in \(x\), for all \(i\), for all agents \(v\):
<center>
All steps of \(v\) in \(Z_{i}\) occur before any step
of \(v\) in \(Z_{i+1}\).
</center>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
Assume that the sufficient condition is
satisfied for epochs of steps in a computation. 

Let \(e\) and \(e'\) be steps in transactions with epoch \(T\) and
\(T'\), respectively, and let \(T < T'\).

Let \(e\) and \(e'\) be steps at the same agent \(v\).

From the observation regarding epochs: \(e\) occurs before \(e'\).

Therefore all steps of a transaction with epoch \(T_{i}\) occur before
any step of a transaction with epoch \(T_{i+1}\).

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">An Algorithm Based on the Sufficent Condition</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
Next, we describe an algorithm based on this idea.

Let's consider the two issues posed by the condition for serializability.

(1) How can the algorithm assign a unique epoch to each transaction?

(2) How can the algorithm assign epochs to steps so that
all steps in a transaction have the epoch of the transaction?



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Uniqueness of a Transaction's Epoch</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------>


A client <code>p</code> initiates a new transaction when
<code>p</code> gets a clock tick message.

To ensure that the epoch of the transaction is unique, an  epoch
<code>t</code> is a pair <code>(n, p_id)</code> where <code>n</code> is a
number and <code>p_id</code> is the id of client <code>p</code>.

Transactions initiated by different clients have different epochs
because their client ids are different.

A client sets the epoch of a new transaction that it initiates to be
greater than epochs of all previous transactions that it initiated.

So, different transactions initiated by the same client have different
epochs.

Therefore each epoch is unique.

<p>
Client ids are totally ordered, and so epochs are also totally
ordered.

For brevity we refer to an epoch by a single value <code>t</code> rather than a
pair <code>(n, p_id)</code>.



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">All Steps in a Transaction have the
Transaction's Epoch</h5>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

We associate a field <code>t</code> with each agent -- client or
server -- where
<code>t</code> is the epoch of the step of the transaction that the agent is
executing.

Likewise, we associate a field <code>m.t</code>
with each message <code>m</code> between clients and servers
where <code>m.t</code> is the epoch of the step in which the message
is sent.

<p>
A message sent in a step of a transaction is received in a step of the
same transaction.

So, for a message <code>m</code> between clients and servers,
<code>m.t</code> is also the epoch of the step in which the message is received.


<p>
We design the algorithm so that all steps of a transaction, all
messages sent in steps of the transaction, and all messages received
in steps of the transaction have the epoch of the transaction.

<p>
Next we give the algorithm for clients and then for servers.



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Client </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<!-------------------------------------------------------->


When a client <code>p</code> gets a clock tick message it executes
<pre>
p.t = p.t + pos()
</pre>
where <code>pos</code> returns a positive value, and 
then <code>p</code>
initiates a new transaction with epoch <code>p.t</code>.

Client <code>p</code> continues executing the transaction with epoch
<code>p.t</code> until <code>p</code> gets its next
clock tick message at which point it increases <code>p.t</code> and
starts a new transaction.

<p>
In the algorithm
all steps of <code>p</code>, all requests sent by <code>p</code> to clients, and all
replies received by <code>p</code> from clients, have epoch
<code>p.t</code>.




<hr class="new2">
<pre>
# Initialization
p.t = 0

start()
def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, ClockTick):
      # Received clock tick
      p.t = p.t + pos()
      # Start new transaction with epoch p.t
      # p.copy stores values in replies.
      p.copy = {}
      # Broadcast read request with epoch p.t
      for q in Q:  send(ReadRequest(p.t), q)

   else:
      # received a reply to a read request
      if message.t == p.t: 
         p.copy[sender] = message.v
         # send write requests if M replies received
         if len(p.copy) >= M:
            # Broadcast write request: value v, epoch t
            v, t = p.f(), p.t
            for q in Q: send(WriteRequest(v, t), q)
</pre>
<hr class="new2">



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Server </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
A server waits to get requests from clients.


<p>
When a server <code>q</code> receives a request <code>r</code> from
the transaction that the server 
is currently processing i.e. <code>r.t</code> \(=\) <code>q.t</code>,
then the server responds to the request. 

<p>
When a server <code>q</code> receives a request <code>r</code> from a
transaction with a smaller 
epoch than the transaction that the server is currently processing,
i.e. <code>r.t</code> \(<\) <code>q.t</code>, then the server does not
respond to the request. The request has the same effect as a request that
is lost.



<p>
What should server <code>q</code> do when it receives a request
<code>r</code> from a transaction with a larger epoch than the
server's epoch, i.e. <code>r.t</code> \(>\) <code>q.t</code>?

<p>
In this case, the server increases its epoch to the
epoch of the request and then responds to the request.

The request, the step in which the server responds to the request,
and the reply (to a read request), have the same epoch.
 

<hr class="new2">
<pre>
# initialization
q.v, q.t = init, 0

start()
def receive(request, client):
   if request.t >= q.t
      q.t = request.t
      if isinstance(request, ReadRequest):
         send(Reply(q.v, q.t), client)
      else:
         // message is a WriteRequest
         q.v = request.v
</pre>
<hr class="new2">





<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Correctness</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------------->
Next we prove that all computations are serializable in a system
specified by these algorithms for clients and servers.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Epoch of a step in a computation of the algorithm</p>
The epoch of a step taken by a client <code>p</code> or server
<code>q</code> is the value of

<code>p.t</code> or <code>q.t</code> (respectively) upon completion of
the step.


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------->

The assignment of epochs to steps satisfies the
condition for epochs, i.e.,
For all
steps \((e, e')\) of a computation
<ol>
  <li>
  if \(e\) and \(e'\) are steps at the same agent, and \(e'\) occurs
  after \(e\) then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\), and
  </li>
  <li>
  if \(e\) is a step in which a message is sent and \(e'\) is a step
  in which that message is received then \(t(e) \leq t(e')\).
  </li>
</ol>



<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
From the algorithms for server <code>p</code> and client
<code>q</code>  it follows that 
<code>p.t</code> and <code>q.t</code> do not decrease in a
computation.

Therefore the first condition is satisfied.

<p>
Also, from the algorithm, the epoch for step in which a request or reply is
received is equal to the epoch in which the message is sent.

So, the second condition is also satisfied.

Therefore the assignment of epochs to steps of a computation satisfy
the specification of epochs.


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------->
The sufficient condition for serializability is satisfied:
(1) each transaction has a unique epoch, and (2) all steps in a
transaction have the epoch of the transaction.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
We have shown that each transaction initiated by a client
<code>p</code> has a unique epoch <code>p.t</code>.

<p>
All steps at <code>p</code> have epoch <code>p.t</code>.

Requests sent by <code>p</code> have epoch <code>p.t</code>.

When a client <code>q</code> gets a request with epoch
<code>p.t</code>, the client  sets its own epoch to
<code>p.t</code> and sends a reply with the same epoch.

So, all steps in a transaction have the epoch of the transaction.

Therefore the algorithm satisfies the sufficient condition for
serializability. 




<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Corollary</h4>
<!--------------------------------------------------->
The algorithm satisfies specifications for serializability.


<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
Follows because the algorithm satisfies the sufficient condition for
serializability.

<p>
Therefore,
if the epochs of transactions in a computation \(x\) are \([T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots]\)
where \(T_{i} < T_{i+1}\), then in \(x\), for all \(i\), for all agents \(v\):

All steps of \(v\) in the transaction with epoch \(T_{i}\) occur before any step
of \(v\) in the transaction with epoch \(T_{i+1}\).
</p>


<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Equivalence of Distributed
and Sequential Algorithms</h3>
<!--------------------------------------------------->

Let the sequence of increasing epochs in a computation \(x\) of the distributed
algorithm be <code>T[1], T[2], T[3], ...</code>, and let
<code>p[i], R[i], W[i]</code> be the values of <code>p, R, W</code> in
the transaction with epoch <code>T[i]</code>.

<p>
The sequence of values of agent variables in 
computation \(x\) of the distributed algorithm is the same as in the
following nondeterministic sequential program by selecting
<code>p, R, W</code>, on the <code>i</code>-th iteration to be
<code>p[i], R[i], W[i]</code> respectively, and by selecting
<code>delta</code> on the <code>i</code>-th iteration so that
<code>T[i] = T[i-1] + delta</code>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Equivalent nondeterministic sequential algorithm</p>


<hr class="new2">
<pre>
t = 0
while True:
   select positive delta, select client p
   t = t + delta

   # p executes transaction with epoch t
   p.t = t
   p.copy = {}

   # Read step
   select R
   for q in R: p.copy[q] = q.v

   # Write step
   if len(p.copy) >= M:
     select W
     for q in W: q.v = p.f()
</pre>
<hr class="new2">

We will prove properties of the sequential algorithm and show that
these properties also hold for the distributed algorithm.


<!------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Next</h3>

Next we develop Paxos, a distributed consensus algorithm.
We prove
that Paxos satisfies the specifications for consensus by showing that
Paxos is serializable.
We prove properties of a nondeterministic sequential algorithm and
show that properties of the sequential algorithm also hold for Paxos.
