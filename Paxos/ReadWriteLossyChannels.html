  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Shared Variables in Faulty Systems</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
A distributed system has agents that read and write shared variables.

Associated with each shared variable is an agent, called a
  <i>manager</i>,
which gets requests to read and write the variable.

The agents that send requests to managers to read or write shared
  variables are called <i>writers</i>.

  The system also has a set of agents called <i>observers</i>.

  When a shared variable is assigned a value, the value is sent to all
  observers. 

  <p>
  We begin with a simple problem.

  Design a distributed algorithm that implements the following
  sequence of iterations.

  In each iteration a single writer <code>p</code> is selected;
  <code>p</code> reads all shared variables and then writes all shared
  variables.

  The <code>n</code>-th message that an observer receives from a
  manager of a shared variable is the <code>n</code>-th value assigned
  to the variable.

  <p>
  An algorithm that does so is: select <code>p</code> in increasing
  order of ids; <code>p</code> sends read requests to all managers of
  shared variables; after getting copies of
  all shared variables from managers <code>p</code> sends requests to
  write all shared variables; after getting confirmations that all
  writes have been completed, <code>p</code> sends a message to a
  writer to start the next iteration.

  When a shared variable is assigned a value the value is sent to observers.
  

  <p>
  Now consider the problem of implementing the same program on a
  distributed system in which messages may get lost, duplicated and
  sent out of order.

  The same algorithm won't work because only
  subsets of shared variables may reply to read requests and execute
  write requests on each iteration.

  The <code>n</code>-th message received by an observer from a manager
  of a shared variable may not be the <code>n</code>-th value assigned
to the variable.

<p>
We begin with a model of a faulty system.

   <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Lossy Channels and Halting Agents </h5>
  <!-------------------------------------------------->

  <p>
  The state of a channel is a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset">multiset or bag</a>.

  An example of a multiset of messages is \(\{b, b, c\}\) which is the
state of a channel with two messages \(b\) and one message \(c\).

  If the channel duplicates \(c\) then the new state is \(\{b, b,
c, c\}\).

  If the channel loses \(b\) then the new state is \(\{b, c, c\}\),
  and if the channel now delivers \(b\) to an agent then the channel's
  state becomes \(\{c, c\}\).

<p>
The sets of writers and shared variables are nonempty but they are not
given.

An agent may stop execution forever or it may halt execution for an
arbitrary period and restart.
    <!--------------------------------------------------------->
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">The Problem</h2>
  <!--------------------------------------------------------->
In each iteration of the sequential algorithm, given above, exactly
  one writer reads and then writes all shared variables.

We will implement the following variant of the sequential algorithm
on a faulty distributed system.

We call the variant <i>Seq</i>.

<p>
<i>Seq</i> initializes variables and then executes a loop.

A single writer <code>p</code> is selected nondeterministically in each
iteration.

The selected writer <code>p</code>
reads and then writes subsets of shared variables.

No writer, other than <code>p</code>,
accesses shared variables in this iteration.

<p>
The writer <code>p</code>, selected on an iteration, determines a
value <code>p.t</code>, called the <i>iteration id.</i>

Later we give rules that ensure that the id of each iteration is unique.


<p>
The manager <code>q</code> of a shared variable has a field
<code>q.var</code> where <code>q.var</code> is a tuple <code>(v,
t)</code> where
<code>v</code> is the value of the shared variable and 
<code>t</code> is the id of the most recent iteration in which
<code>v</code> was assigned a value.

<p>
Each writer <code>p</code> has a local variable <code>p.copy</code>, a
dictionary, where <code>p.copy[q]</code> contains a (possibly stale)
copy of <code>q.var</code>.

Each writer <code>p</code> also has a local variable <code>p.t</code>
which is the id of the most recent iteration in which <code>p</code>
was selected as the writer that accesses shared variables.

<p>
We describe the steps of the sequential program later.



<!---------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Sequential Program Seq</h4>
<!---------------------------------------------------->
    <pre>
for p in P: p.t = 0
for q in Q: q.var = (None, 0)

while True:
   select a writer p
   p.t = p.t + pos()

   p.copy = {}
   for q in read_set: p.copy[q] = q.var

   if g(p):
      for q in write_set: q.var = (f(p, q), p.t)
</pre>

<code>None</code> is a value that indicates unassigned.

<code>pos</code> is a function that returns a positive value.

The value returned by <code>pos</code> impacts the performance, but not
the correctness of the algorithm.


<p>
<code>read_set</code> and <code>write_set</code> are subsets of
managers of shared variables.

These subsets are selected nondeterministically.


<p>
The iteration id determined by a selected writer <code>p</code> is a
pair <code>(n,p.id)</code> where 
<code>n</code> is a number, and 
<code>p.id</code> is the id of <code>p</code>.

So, different writers cannot determine the same iteration id.

When <code>p</code> starts an iteration it increases <code>p.t</code>.

So, different iterations in which <code>p</code> is the selected
writer have different ids.

<p>
(We don't include <code>p.id</code> explicitly in the algorithm
description so that we can focus on more important aspects.)


<p>
<code>p</code> reads shared variables in <code>read_set</code>, and
<code>p</code> writes shared variables in <code>write_set</code> only 
if condition <code>g(p)</code> holds.

For example, an algorithm may write shared variables only if 
<code>read_set</code> is not empty.

<p>
In the statement that writes shared variables, <code>f(p,q)</code> is
assigned to the value field, 
and <code>p.t</code> is assigned to the iteration id field of
<code>q.var</code>.

<p>
The nondeterministic statements of Seq 
are the statements that select <code>p</code>,
<code>read_set</code> and <code>write_set</code> in each iteration;
different selections of these variables result in different executions
of Seq.
An instance of Seq is a deterministic algorithm with a given selection of these
variables.


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Specification</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

Design a distributed algorithm in which agents are writers, managers of shared
variables and observers, and in which an observer receives
a message <code>m</code> 
from a manager <code>q</code> of a shared variable only if
<code>q.var = m</code> at some point in the execution of an instance
of Seq.


<p>
Observers cannot distinguish between messages that they receive in the
distributed algorithm and values of shared variables in Seq.

<p>
In the observer pattern, agents sends descriptions of events to
observers which construct the dataflow of a computation.

In our algorithm, copies of shared variables are sent to observers.
x
Messages may, however, be lost, duplicated and delivered out of order.

What can we deduce from the messages that observers receive?

<p>
If an observer receives <code>(v, t)</code> and <code>(v', t)</code>
from <code>q</code> and <code>q'</code>, respectively, 
then we know that <code>q.var</code> and <code>q'.var</code> were
assigned values <code>(v, t)</code> and <code>(v', t)</code>,
respectively, in the same iteration -- the iteration with unique id
<code>t</code>. 

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">How Should You Approach The Problem?</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
We want to design a distributed algorithm for which the dataflow graph can
be partitioned into a sequence of subgraphs where each subgraph is the
dataflow of exactly one iteration.

What method comes to mind to partition a dataflow graph into dataflow
subgraphs? 

<p>
Logical time partitions dataflow into a past and future -- events with
logical time at most \(t\) or greater than \(t\).

So we use iteration ids in a similar way.

<p>
As with logical times, each event <code>e</code> is assigned an
iteration id <code>t(e)</code>.

We design an algorithm in which all events that 
implement an iteration with id
<code>T</code> also have iteration id <code>T</code>.

<p>
The following aspects of iteration ids are the same as with logical time.
Each agent <code>A</code> has a local variable
<code>A.t</code> which is the iteration id of the most recent event at
<code>A</code>.

And each message <code>m</code> has a
timestamp <code>m.t</code> which is the iteration id of the event in
which the message is sent.

<p>
The difference between iteration ids and logical time is as follows.

The logical time of an event that receives a message is
<i>strictly greater</i> than the logical time of the event that sends the message.

By contrast, 
the iteration id of the event in which a request is received is <i>the
same as</i> the iteration id of the event in which that request is
sent.

This condition is achieved by the following rule.



<p class="w3-text-teal">The Key Rule</p>
<p>
When a manager at iteration id <code>t</code>
  gets a request with iteration id <code>t'</code>
<ol>
  <li>
  If <code>t'</code> \(<\) <code>t</code> the request is ignored.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <code>t'</code> \(\geq\) <code>t</code> then the manager processes
  the request by setting its own iteration id and the iteration id of
  the event that receives the request to <code>t'</code>, and sending
  a reply with iteration id <code>t'</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
Ignoring a message is equivalent to losing the message -- the message
is removed from the channel and the states of agents don't change.

An event in which a message is lost is assigned the iteration id of
the event in which the message is sent.

<p>
The key rule ensures that iteration id of an event in which a request
is received is the same as the timestamp of the request which is the
same as the iteration id of the event that sends the request.

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<p>
We give the algorithm for managers in Python-like pseudo code and
explain the algorithm later.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Managers of Shared Variables</h4>
<pre>
self.t = 0

start()
def receive(request, writer):
   if request.t >= self.messaget:
      self.t = request.t
      if isinstance(request, ReadRequest):
         send(Reply(self.var, self.t), writer)
      else:
         // message is a WriteRequest
         self.var = request.var
</pre>


<p>
If the timestamp <code>request.t</code> of the request 
is greater than or equal to the iteration id <code>self.t</code> of
the manager that receives the request, 
then the manager takes the following steps.
<ol>
  <li>
  The manager's iteration id, <code>self.t</code>, is set to the
  timestamp of the request. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The iteration id of the event that receives the request
  is defined to be the timestamp of the request.
  A reply, <code>Reply(self.var, self.t)</code> to the read request
  has the iteration id <code>self.t</code> of the manager which is the
  same as the timestamp of the request. 
  </li>
  <li>
  If a write request is received then the shared variable
  <code>self.var</code> is assigned
  the value <code>request.var</code> specified in the request.
  </li>
</ol>


<p>
If the request's timestamp is less than the manager's iteration id
then the request is ignored.

<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Writers</h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->


<p>

Each writer <code>p</code> sends itself a <code>start_new_iteration</code> message.

A writer starts a new iteration when it receives a
<code>start_new_iteration</code> message.

The writer increases its iteration id
by a positive amount <code>self.pos()</code>.

The writer's new iteration id is the unique iteration id for all the
events that represent an iteration of Seq with this iteration id.

<p>
The writer discards earlier copies of shared variables;
sends read requests and sends a <code>start_new_iteration</code> message to
itself.

The writer then waits to receive the
<code>start_new_iteration</code> message and waits to receive replies to
its read requests. 

<p>
If the writer receives a reply then it
adds the <code>var</code> field of the reply to its local copy, and if
condition <code>g()</code> 
holds then it sends write requests.

<p>
If the writer receives a <code>start_new_iteration</code> before
<code>g()</code> holds then it starts a new
iteration without sending write requests.



<p>
We give the algorithm in Python-like pseudo code and then describe the
algorithm.

<pre>
self.t = 0
send(message=StartNewIteration(), receiver=self)
start()

def receive(message, sender):
   if isinstance(message, StartNewIteration):
      // start new iteration with larger iteration id.
      self.t = self.t + self.h()

      self.copy = {}
      for q in Q: send(ReadRequest(t = self.t), q)

      send(StartNewIteration(), self)

   elif message.t == self.t:
        // message is a reply to a read request 
        self.copy[sender] = message.var
        if self.g():
           for q in Q:
               send(WriteRequest(var = self.f(q), t=self.t), q)
</pre>


<p>
A writer only receives replies with epoch times less than or equal to the
writer's epoch time.

This is because 
the epoch time of a reply is the epoch time of the writer when it
sent the request, and a writer's epoch time never decreases.



<p>
The writer ignores replies that have epoch timestamps that are 
less than the writer's epoch time <code>p.t</code>.

Therefore, a reply sent at epoch time <code>p.t</code> is lost,
ignored, or received
by <code>p</code> at epoch time <code>p.t</code>.



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Performance Issues</h3>
<!-------------------------------------------------->





<p>
The events in the dataflow of an iteration are as follows.

<ol>
  <li>
  A single writer <code>p</code> is selected.
  </li>
  <li>
  The epoch time <code>p.t</code> is increased and the resulting epoch
  time uniquely identifies the iteration -- no other iteration has the
  same epoch time.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>p</code> sends read requests to shared variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  A read request may get lost, or the manager may ignore the request,
  or the manager may send a reply.
  </li>
  <li>
  A reply may get lost, or <code>p</code> may ignore the reply, or
  <code>p</code> may copy the reply into a local variable and send
  write requests if <code>g(p)</code> holds.
  </li>
  <li>
  A write request may get lost, or a manger may ignore the request, or
  the manager may assign the value specified in the request to the
  shared variable.
  </li>
</ol>


<p>
Ignoring a message has the same effect as losing the message -- the
message is removed from the channel without changing agent states.

<p>
<code>read_set</code> is the set of managers that send replies that
<code>p</code> copies in step 5.
<code>write_set</code> is the set of managers that assign
values to shared variables specified in write requests in step 6.



<p>
<i>The Problem</i>:

Determine how to select a single writer <code>p</code> for each
iteration and which requests and replies to ignore and which to process so that:
<hr class="new2">
  <p style="color:blue;">
Values assigned to shared variables in the distributed
and sequential algorithms are identical.
</p>
<hr class="new2">




<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Message Types</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
  A read request is an instance of a class <code>ReadRequest</code>
