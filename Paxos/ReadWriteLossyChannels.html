  <a

  In this webpage we develop algorithms for systems in which agents
  may halt or be arbitrarily slow; the same message may be delivered
  multiple times; messages may be delivered out of order; and messages
  may be lost.  The <a
  href="../DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_MODELS/Basics.html"> model that we used
  in the previous chapters </a> no longer applies.

      

    <!-----START SECTION: Transactions ------------>

    <a name="Transactions"></a>
    
  <p>
  We develop an algorithm for a system that consists of a set of
  agents called <i>clients</i> and a set of agents called
  <i>servers</i>.  There is a channel from each server to each client,
  and from each client to each server.  Clients execute transactions
  in which they send requests to servers to read and write variables
  managed by servers.
    
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Servers</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

    <p>
    Each server <code>q</code> has a variable <code>q.v</code>.
    Clients send requests to <code>q</code> to read or write
    <code>q.v</code>.  A server <code>q</code> replies to a read
    request from a client <code>p</code> by sending <code>p</code> a
    copy of <code>q.v</code>.  When a server <code>q</code> receives a
    request to write <code>v</code> the server assigns <code>v</code>
    to <code>q.v</code>.  The only actions of a server are to respond
    to requests from clients.
    </p>

 
<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="w3-text-teal">Clients</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

    <p>
    In a transaction, a <i>single</i> client reads and then writes server variables.
    A client <code>p</code> sends read requests to
    servers and receives replies from them.  Requests and replies may
    get lost.  Let <code>R</code> be the set of servers from which
    <code>p</code> receives replies.
    If <code>p</code> receives at least <code>M</code> replies, where
    <code>M</code> is a parameter of the algorithm, then
    <code>p</code> proceeds to the write step of the transaction.
    If <code>p</code> receives fewer than <code>M</code> replies, then
    <code>p</code>  terminates the transaction without executing a
    write step.
    </p>

    <p>
    Associated with each client <code>p</code> is a function
    <code>f_p</code> which takes a list of server values as its
    argument.  In the write step <code>p</code> broadcasts requests to
    servers to write: <pre> f_p(r.v for r in R) </pre> where <code>r.v
    for r in R</code> is the list of replies that client
<code>p</code> receives to its read requests.
</p>

<p>
Write requests may get lost.
Let <code>W</code> be the set of servers that receive and execute
the write requests.
</p>



<hr class="new2">
<p class="w3-text-teal">Transaction executed by client
<code>p</code></p>
<pre>
if len(R) >= M:
   for q in W:  q.v = f_p(r.v for r in R)
</pre>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
A transaction consists of a synchronous read of the values of a subset
<code>R</code> of server variables followed by a synchronous write to
a subset <code>W</code> of server variables.
Next we use <a
href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html">epochs</a>
in a distributed algorithm in which the values assigned
to server variables are the same as in a computation in which
<i>exactly one transaction is executed at a time.</i>

  <div id="SECTION">
    <a name="DistributedAlgorithm"></a>
    
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Distributed Algorithm</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

We <a
    href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html#EpochTheorem">showed
    that</a> given any computation \(C\), there exists a computation
    \(C'\) where:
    <ol>
      <li>
      For each agent \(v\) the sequence of steps at
      \(v\) is the same in \(C\) and \(C'\), and
      </li>
      <li>
      steps in \(C'\) are executed in ascending order of epochs.
      </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Next we describe an algorithm in which each transaction has a unique
epoch and all steps of a transaction have the epoch of the
    transaction.
    Therefore in \(C'\) all steps of a transaction with epoch \(t\)
  are executed after steps of transactions with epoch less than \(t\)
  and before steps of transactions with epoch greater than \(t\).
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Ensuring that each Epoch is Unique</h6>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<p>
To ensure that the epoch of each transaction is unique, an epoch is an
ordered pair <code>(t, p_id)</code> where <code>p_id</code> is the id
of client <code>p</code> and <code>t</code> is a number. A client
<code>p</code> increases the <code>t</code>-component of an epoch at
each successive transaction that <code>p</code> executes. Epochs
of transactions executed by different clients are different because
their ids are different.
Epochs of different transactions executed by the same client are
different because the <code>t</code>-components are different.
</p>

<p>
In the description of the algorithm we use the short form
<code>t</code> for an epoch rather than <code>(t, p_id)</code>.
We implicitly assume that an epoch has a <code>p_id</code>-component without
writing it explicitly.
We assume that client ids are totally ordered and so 
epochs are also totally ordered.
</p>


    
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h6 class="w3-text-teal">All Steps of a Transaction have the Epoch of
the Transaction</h6>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<p>
Each agent <code>x</code> has a field <code>x.t</code> where the epoch
    of a step taken by <code>x</code> is <code>x.t</code>, and so
    <code>x.t</code> is the epoch of the transaction that
    <code>x</code> is processing.
    Each message <code>m</code> has a field <code>m.t</code> called
    the epoch of the message.
    When an agent <code>x</code> sends a message <code>m</code> it sets
    <code>m.t</code> to <code>x.t</code>.
    When an agent <code>y</code> receives a message <code>m</code> the
agent processes the message only if <code>m.t = y.t</code>.
If <code>m.t</code> \(\neq\) <code>y.t</code> then <code>m</code> is
discarded without being processed, and <code>m</code> has the same
effect as a lost message. So all steps and messages in a transaction
have the epoch of the transaction.



<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Server </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<p>
A server waits to get requests from clients. Let's look at three cases
for steps taken by a server <code>q</code> when it receives a request
<code>r</code>.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <code>r.t</code> \(<\) <code>q.t</code>:
  <p>
  If a server <code>q</code> receives a request <code>r</code> from a
  transaction with an epoch <code>r.t</code>
  that is smaller than the epoch <code>q.t</code> of the transaction
  that <code>q</code> is processing then <code>q</code> ignores the
  request. An ignored request has the same effect as a request that
  is lost.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>r.t</code> \(=\) <code>q.t</code>:
  <p>
  If a server receives a request from the transaction that the server is
  processing then the server responds to the request.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>r.t</code> \(>\) <code>q.t</code>:
  <p>
  If a server <code>q</code> receives a request from a transaction
  with an epoch 
  <code>r.t</code>  that is greater than the epoch <code>q.t</code> of
  the transaction that the server is processing then
  the server stops processing the transaction with epoch
  <code>q.t</code>; it increases <code>q.t</code> to <code>r.t</code>;
  and it starts processing the transaction with the increased value of
  <code>q.t</code> by responding to the request.
  </li>
</ol>
Therefore the epoch <code>q.t</code> of a step in which a server
<code>q</code> responds to a request <code>r</code> is the same as
<code>r.t</code> -- the epoch of the request.
<p>
A reply sent by <code>q</code> to a read request has fields
<code>q.v</code> and <code>q.t</code>.
A server <code>q</code> responds to a request to write a value
<code>request.v</code> by assigning <code>request.v</code> to <code>q.v</code>.
</p>

<hr class="new2">

q.v, q.t = init, 0

def receive(request, client):
   if request.t >= q.t
      q.t = request.t
      if isinstance(request, ReadRequest):
         # send reply to client
         send(Reply(q.v, q.t), client)
      else:
         // message is a WriteRequest
         q.v = request.v
</pre>
<hr class="new2">


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for a Client </h4>
<!-------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Each client <code>p</code> has a variable <code>p.copy</code> into
which <code>p</code> copies replies to its read requests.
<code>p.copy</code> is a dictionary and <code>p</code> copies the
reply that it gets from a server <code>q</code> into
<code>p.copy[q]</code>. 
</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
Each client gets a sequence of messages called clock ticks.
A clock tick message has no fields.
A client initiates a new transaction when the client gets a clock tick
message. This is the only way in which a transaction is created.
A clock tick has no function other than to make a client stop
the transaction that it is processing and start a new transaction.

<p>
When a client <code>p</code> gets a clock tick message it executes:
</p>
<pre>
p.t = p.t + pos()
</pre>
<p>
where <code>pos</code> returns an arbitrary positive value, and then
<code>p</code> initiates a new transaction with epoch
<code>p.t</code>.  Client <code>p</code> continues executing the
transaction with epoch <code>p.t</code> until <code>p</code> gets its
next clock tick message at which point <code>p</code> stops executing
the transaction with with epoch <code>p.t</code>, it increases
<code>p.t</code> and starts a new transaction with the increased value
of <code>p.t</code> as the epoch of the new transaction.
</p>

<p>
A client <code>p</code> starts a new transaction by setting <code>p.copy</code> to
empty and sending read requests to all servers.
A read request has a single field which is the epoch
of the transaction that <code>p</code> is executing.
A client waits to receive replies from servers and waits simultaneously for the
next clock tick.
</p>


<p>
If <code>p</code> receives a reply, <code>message</code>, sent in the
transaction that <code>p</code> is processing, i.e, if
<code>message.t</code> \(=\) <code>p.t</code>, then <code>p</code>
copies the value in the reply into <code>p.copy</code>.
</p>

<p>
If the client receives at least <code>M</code> replies before it
receives its next clock tick then the client proceeds to the write
step.  If the client receives its next clock tick before it receives
<code>M</code> replies then the client does not execute a write step
and the transaction terminates.
</p>


<p>
In the write step, <code>p</code>
broadcasts write requests to servers.
The list of replies,
<code>r.v for r in R</code>, that <code>p</code> received in this transaction is 
<code>list(p.copy.values())
</code>
<p>
A write request has two fields, the value <code>v</code> to be written
and the epoch of the transaction in which the request is made.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Serializability</h3>
  <!--------------------------------------------------->
  Given a computation \(C\) of the distributed algorithm we will show
  that the sequence of values of each server variable \(q.v\) is the
  same as in a computation in which transactions are executed
  sequentially in order of increasing epoch.
  Let <code>t[i]</code> be the transaction in \(C\) with the
  <code>i</code>-th largest epoch for <code>i</code> > 0.

  <p>
  Let <code>p[i]</code> be the client that executes the transaction
  and let <code>R[i]</code> be the set of servers from which
  <code>p[i]</code> receives replies to its read requests, and
  <code>W[i]</code> the set of servers that receive write
  requests in the transaction. So, <code>R[i]</code> is the set of
  servers from which  
  <code>p[i]</code> receives reply <code>r</code> where <code>r.t =
  t[i]</code>, and <code>W[i]</code> is the set of
  servers that receive write requests <code>w</code> where <code>m.t =
  t[i]</code>. 


  <!--------------------------------------------------->
  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Serializability Theorem</h4>
  <!--------------------------------------------------->
  For each server <code>q</code>, the sequence of values of
  <code>q.v</code> in the distributed computation \(C\) is the same as
  in the following sequential loop.
  
  <hr class="new2">
<pre>
for i in positive_integers:
   if len(R[i]) >= M:
      for q in W[i]:  q.v = f_p(r.v for r in R[i])
</pre>
<hr class="new2">
  <p>
  Note: <code>for i in positive_integers</code> is the pseudo-code notation
that generates the infinite sequence of positive integers, 1,
2, 3.....
  </p>
 
  <!--------------------------------------------------->
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
  <!--------------------------------------------------->
  The <a href="../ChannelSnapshots/LogicalClocks.html">two rules for assigning
  epochs to steps</a>  are satisfied:
  The epoch <code>x.t</code>
  of an agent <code>x</code> does not decrease, and the epoch of a step in which a
  message is received is greater than or equal to the epoch of the
  step in which the message is sent. 

  <p>
  From the theorem on epochs, given any computation \(C\) of the distributed algorithm
  there exists a computation \(C'\) where:
  <ol>
  <li>
  For each server
    <code>q</code> the sequence of values assigned to <code>q.v</code>
  is the same in \(C\) and \(C'\), and
  </li>
  <li>
   transactions are executed sequentially in \(C'\), one transaction
  at a time, in ascending order of epochs.
  </li>
</ol>

  Therefore, the sequence of values assigned to server variables,
  in a computation of the distributed algorithm is the same as in the sequential
  algorithm in which the \(i\)-th transaction of the sequential algorithm is  the
  transaction with the \(i\)-th largest epoch in the computation of
  the distributed algorithm.

  <p>
  Next we describe an
  algorithm that records the epoch in which a server variable is
  assigned a value. A server variable <code>q.v</code>
  a tuple <code>(q.v.s, q.v.t)</code>
  where <code>q.v.t</code> is the latest epoch in which
  <code>q</code> assigned a value to
  <code>q.v</code>.
  Client and server algorithms are as given earlier
  except for one change to the client algorithm: the statement

  <code>
  v = p.f(...)

  <br>
  is replaced by
  <br>
  <code>

  The values assigned to server variables in a computation of the
