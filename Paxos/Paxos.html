    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The Paxos Algorithm</h1>

  Next, we study an algorithm, called
  
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
  <i>Paxos</i>,
  by which agents determine a single consensus value from a set of
  proposed values even though messages may be lost, messages may
overtake each other, agents  may be arbitrarily slow, and agents  may
  stop and restart.

  From
  <a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html">the
  FLP theorem</a>,
  there is no algorithm that guarantees that
  consensus among agents will be reached if messages can
  be lost or 
  delayed for arbitrary time, and if agents may fail or be
  arbitrarily slow.

  Next we describe an algorithm,
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
  <i>Paxos</i>,
  that enables consensus
to be reached in most situations, though there is a possibility that
  consensus may never be reached.

  Before describing Paxos, we describe a simpler problem which gives
  insight into Paxos.

  <h1>OLD</h1>

  In this situation, 
<a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html">the
  FLP theorem</a>,
  says there is no algorithm that guarantees that consensus will be reached 


  Next we describe an algorithm that enables consensus
to be reached in most situations, though there is a possibility that
consensus may never be reached. We can use probabalistic algorithms to
reduce the probability of never reaching consensus.

   
<p>
This module describes, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
    <i>Paxos</i>, an important algorithm</a> by which agents in a
    distributed system come to a consensus.


There are other algorithms, such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)"> <i>Raft</i>
</a> that deal with this problem; we will describe them later.

    
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Assumptions</h3>

<p>
The Paxos algorithm deals with messages that may be lost and that may
overtake each other. Agents  may stop and restart later,
and agents  may be arbitrarily slow. By contrast, in the
algorithms that we have discussed so far, we assume that messages are
not lost; messages sent along a channel are delivered in the order
sent; and agents do not stop.


<p>
The Paxos algorithm, and most distributed algorithms studied here,
assume that messages are not modified while in transit and that agents
do not have <a href="../Byzantine/Byzantine.html">Byzantine
faults.</a>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h3>

<p>
The algorithm has agents called
<i>proposers</i> and others called <i>learners</i>. (In an
implementation an agent may play the role of both proposer and
learner.) Proposers propose values. Learners come to a consensus among
    the proposed values.

    <p>
Associated with each learner \(L\) is a local variable \(L.value\)
which is initially \(null\). Associated with each proposer \(P\) is a
local constant \(P.VALUE\) which is the value that the
proposer is proposing.
<p>
The specification has three parts.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  <p> For every learner \(L\):
  <p>
  \(
  (L.value = null) \quad \vee \quad
  (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \: P : L.value = P.VALUE)
  \)
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <i>A learner doesn't change the value that it learns.</i>
  <p>
  For all learners \(L\), and for all non-null values \(V\):
  <p>
  \(
  stable (L.value = V)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  <p>
  For all learners \(L\) and \(L'\):
  <p>
  \(
  (L.value = null) \vee (L'.value = null) \vee 
  ( L.value = L'.value)
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">The Paxos Algorithm</h2>
The Paxos Algorithm, proposed by Leslie Lamport, has an additional
layer of agents called <i>acceptors</i>. The communication structure
between agents is shown in the figure below. Proposers send and
receive messages from acceptors.

<p>
Learners receive messages from
acceptors. Learners do not send messages to proposers or
acceptors. Learners may send messages to each other, but we ignore such
messages in our description of the algorith because while these
messages can improve the algorithm's efficiency they are not required.

<p>

    <figcaption>Fig.1: Proposers, Acceptors and Learners</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Local Variables and Messages</h4>
In the description of the algorithm;
<br>
<i>A timestamp</i> is a pair
  <code>(n, pid)</code>, where <code>n</code> is a number
  and <code>pid</code> is the id
  of a proposer. Proposer ids are totally ordered and are used to break
ties between timestamps used by different producers.
We assume that <code>n</code> is a nonnegative integer that is
initially 0.
<p>
<i>A value</i> is either <code>null</code> or <code>P.VALUE</code>
for some proposer <code>P</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local variable and constant for proposer
<code>P</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Variable: <code>P.t</code>, timestamp which is initially <code>(0,
  P_id)</code> where <code>P_id</code> is <code>P</code>'s id. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Constant: <code>P.VALUE</code>, value
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local variables for acceptor
<code>A</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <code>A.t</code>, timestamp, which is initially <code>(0,
  null)</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.accept_v</code>, value which is initially <code>null</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.accept_t</code>, timestamp, which is initially <code>(0,
  null)</code>. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Messages</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  proposer to acceptors: <i>new_time(timestamp)</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  acceptor replies: <i>updated_time(timestamp, value, timestamp)</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  proposer to acceptors: <i>proposal(timestamp, value)</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  acceptors to learners: <i>accept(timestamp, value)</i>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Learners</h4>
The algorithm for learners is simple:
A learner determines that the consensus value is <code>V</code> if the
learner receives <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages from a majority of
acceptors with identical values of <code>(T, V)</code>.
We ignore learners in the algorithm description, and restrict
attention to whether and when a majority of
acceptors sends <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages with identical
values of <code>(T, V)</code>. 

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Proposers and Acceptors</h3>

<p>
The algorithm for proposers and acceptors is given below.

<pre>
// Proposer P. Step P.1. Send new_time to acceptors
P.t +=  any positive value
send new_time(P.t) to all acceptors

// Acceptor A. Step A.1. Reply with updated_time to new_time
//   message from P
upon receiving new_time(t) from any proposer P:
   if t > A.t:
      A.t = t
      send updated_time(A.t, A.accept_v, A.accept_t) to P

// Proposer P. Step P.2. Send proposal to acceptors
wait to receive updated_time(t, accept_v, accept_t) messages from a
     majority of acceptors where t == P.t or timeout.

If wait condition is satisfied:
     if accept_v is null for all of these messages:
        P.v = P.VALUE
     else:
        let updated_time(A*.t*, A*.accept_v*, A*.accept_t*)  be
          the message with the largest A.accept_t among these messages
        P.v = A*.accept_v*
     send proposal(P.t, P.v) to all acceptors
If timeout:
     return to step P.1
      
// Acceptor A. Step A.2. Send accept to learners
upon receiving proposal(t, v) from P:
    if t >= A.t:
       A.t, A.accept_t, A.accept_v = t, t, v
       send accept(A.accept_t, A.accept_v) to all learners
</pre>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm Steps</h4>
The algorithm has only one point where an agent waits: Step P.2.
In step P.2, a proposer waits for a bounded time
to receive promise messages from a majority of acceptors. If these
messages don't arrive within this time then the proposer aborts this
iteration and starts the next iteration, i.e. back to step P.1,
without completing step P.2.

<p>
A proposer repeatedly executes a loop consisting of steps P.1 and P.2.
For the time being assume that the loop never terminates; we will
discuss termination later.

<p>
Acceptors respond immediately to messages that they receive.

<p>
In the discussion, we refer to <code>P.t</code> and <code>A.t</code>
as <code>P</code>'s timestamp and <code>A</code>'s timestamp,
respectively. We refer to <code>A.accept_v</code> as the value
accepted by <code>A</code>, and <code>A.accept_t</code> as the
timestamp of the value accepted by <code>A</code>. Notice that
<code>A.accept_t</code> and <code>A.accept_v</code> are modified
together, and only in step A.2 when an acceptor receives a
<code>proposal</code>.


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
The figure below shows a system timeline with 3 acceptors and 2
proposers. Timelines for learners are not shown. The events on the
timeline are: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>N(t)</i>: A proposer sends <code>new_time(t)</code> message, and
  the proposer's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>U(t)</i>: An acceptor replies to the proposer with a
  <code>updated_time(t, accept_v, accept_t)</code> message, and 
  the acceptor's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>P(t)</i>: A proposer responds with a
  <code>proposal(t, v)</code> message, and the proposer's timestamp at
  this event is <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A(t)</i>: An acceptor accepts a proposer's
  <code>proposal(t, v)</code> by 
  sending a
  <code>accept(accept_v, accept_t)</code> message to learners, and 
  the acceptor's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>. The accept messages to learners are not shown.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the diagram, <code>new_time</code> messages are grey,
<code>updated_time</code> messages are purple, and
<code>proposals</code> are black. The <code>new_time(t)</code> message
sent by proposer P0 to acceptor A2 is lost, and the the <code>proposal</code> sent
by P0 to acceptor A1 is lost.

<figure>
    <img src="PaxosFigures/PaxosFigures.012.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Timelines</figcaption>
</figure>



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Observations about the Algorithm</h3>
The following observations are helpful in understanding the algorithm.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Acceptor's Timeline</h5>
The figure below illustrates the timeline of an acceptor
<code>A</code> which receives messages from proposers <code>Y</code>
and <code>Z</code>.
<p>
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosLecture/PaxosLecture.003.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Acceptor's Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>
The arrows from the proposors' timelines to <code>A</code>'s timeline
represent messages sent by the proposer and accepted by
<code>A</code>. Lost messages are not shown.

<p>
The number next to the message is the timestamp of the message. A
timestamp is a pair (integer, proposer id); however, the proposer id
is not shown.

<p>
<code>A</code>'s timestamp is initially 0. When <code>A</code>
receives a message with timestamp 4 it increases its
timestamp to 4. Then <code>A</code> receives a message with timestamp
3 which it ignores because the message timestamp is lower
than its time. When <code>A</code> gets a message with
timestamp 6, <code>A</code> increases its timestamp to 6.

<p>
An acceptor's timeline can be partitioned into intervals where the
acceptor's time within each interval remains constant and increases
from an interval to the following one.
</p>




 

<p> In step A.1 if <code>t < A.t</code>, and in step A.2 if <code>t <=
A.t</code>, the message received by the acceptor is ignored. In step
P.2, an <code>updated_time</code> message received by a proposer
<code>P</code> is ignored if the <code>time</code> component of the
message is different from <code>P.t</code> Hereafter, we won't
consider messages that are ignored by agents. A diagram showing acceptor
<code>A</code>'s timeline without ignored or lost messages is shown
below where the blue arrows are messages from proposers.

<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosLecture/PaxosLecture.023.jpeg" alt="Fig3" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Acceptor's Timeline without Ignored Messages</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
  Ignored messages are treated as lost messages.
</p>
<hr class="new2">
Hereafter, a <i>received message</i> is one that is not lost and is not ignored by the
receiver: it is a message in which the receiver takes some action upon
receiving the message.


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proposer's Timeline</h5>
An example of a proposer's timeline is shown in the figure below.

<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosLecture/PaxosLecture.024.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Proposer's Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>
The proposer's timeline can also be partitioned into intervals within
    which the proposer's time remains constant. In this diagram,
    proposer <code>p</code>'s time is initially 0, and the proposer
    increases its time in step P.1. Let the new time be 10. Then the
    proposer sends <code>new_time(10)</code> to all acceptors. The
    proposer ignores all messages it gets next except for
    <code>updated_time(10, ..,)</code> messages with the same
    timestamp, 10. If it gets a majority of such messages, it sends 
<code>proposal(10, ..)</code> to all acceptors.
<p>
Likewise, in the next interval, while the proposer's time is 35, all
    the messages that the proposer sends and receives have the same
    timestamp: 35. (Recall that ignored messages are treated as lost
messages, and are treated as having been not received.)

<p>
  From the algorithm, the only new values of time are created by
  proposers in step P.1. Message timestamps and agent times in all
  other steps of the algorithm are obtained from messages received by
  agents.
  
<p>
As you can see: 
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
While a proposer's time is <code>t</code>, the timestamps of 
all messages that the proposer sends and receives is
<code>t</code>.
</p>
<hr class="new2">


The algorithm has the following easily-checked properties, for all acceptors \(A\) and
proposers \(P\):
<p>
invariant: \( \; A.accept\_t \leq A.t \)
<p>
invariant: \( \; (A.accept\_t = 0) \; \equiv \; (A.accept\_v = null) \)
<p>
\(A.t\), \(A.accept\_t\) and \(P.t\) never decrease.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Ignored messages</h4>
Messages that are lost or ignored do not change the states of
agents. <i>Processed</i> messages are messages that an agent receives
and then carries out an action such as sending a message. Processed
messages are:
<ol>
  <li>
    \(new\_time(T)\) messages received by an
    acceptor \(A\) when \(T > A.t\). See step A.1.
			     </li>
<li>
  \(proposal(T)\) messages received by an
    acceptor \(A\) when \(T \geq A.t\). See step A.2.
  </li>
<li>
  \(updated\_time(T)\) messages received by a proposer \(P\) when
  \(T = P.t\). See step P.2.
  </li>
</ol>


Because ignored messages don't change states of agents: 
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
  We only consider processed messages in trajectories.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

Every event in the algorithm sends a  \(new_time\),
\(updated_time\), \(proposal\), or \(accept\) message. Define the time
of the event as the timestamp of the messages sent in the event. This
is also the timestamp of the agent when it sends the message.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Semi-synchronous trajectories</h4>
We begin by proving that the Paxos algorithm satisfies its
specifications for semi-synchronous trajectories and later carry out
the proof for all trajectories.
<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
A semi-synchronous trajectory is one that can be partitioned
into epochs where all events with the same timestamp are in the same
epoch. 
</p>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
  An epoch in which events have timestamp \(t\) is called epoch
  \(t\). Because timestamps are pairs (integer, process id), and all
  timestamps are created by proposers when they <i>send new_time</i>
  messages, it follows that exactly one proposer sends messages within
  an epoch.

  
<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.008.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Example of epochs in a semi-synchronous trajectory</figcaption>
</figure>
The diagram shows a semi-synchronous trajectory with three epochs with
times \(t^{0}\), \(t^{1}\), and \(t^{2}\), shown
in brown, blue and green, respectively. All the events and messages in epoch
\(t^{i}\) have timestamp \(t^{i}\). In epochs \(t^{0}\) and \(t^{2}\)
the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P1, while in
epoch \(t^{1}\) the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P0.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{0}\), proposer P1 increases its time (see step P.1) to  \(t^{0}\)
  and sends \(new\_time(t^{0})\) messages --- shown as brown arrows ---
  to acceptors. The message to acceptor A0 is lost. An acceptor \(A\)
  that gets the message replies with \(updated\_time(t^{0},
  A.accept\_v, A.accept\_t)\). Proposer P1 waits to receive at least 2
  \(updated\_time\) messages because 2 is a majority for a set of 3
  agents. When it receives the 2 messages, P1 sends  \(proposal(t^{0},
  P1.v)\) messages to acceptors. In this diagram, the \(proposal\)
  messages sent to A0 and A1 are lost while A2 receives the
  message which, in turn, sends \(accept\) messages. In this epoch, a
  majority of acceptors do not send \(accept\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{1}\), proposer P0 increases its time, and sends
  \(new\_time(t^{1})\) messages. P0 timesout waiting to receive
  \(updated\_time\) messages from a majority of acceptors, and so it
  sends no \(proposal\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{2}\), proposer P1 increases its time, and sends
  \(new\_time(t^{2})\) messages. P1 receives
  \(updated\_time\) messages from a majority of acceptors; sends
  proposals to acceptors; receives replies from a majority of
  acceptors, and then sends \(proposal\) messages. The
  \(proposal\) messages are received by a majority of acceptors, each
  of which sends \(accept\) messages. So, learners that receive
  \(accept\) messages from a majority of acceptors, set the values
  that they learned to the value in the \(accept\) messages.
  
  



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h3>
If a majority of acceptors accept the same value, \(V^{*}\) in an
epoch \(T^{*}\) of a semi-synchronous 
trajectory, then in all subsequent epochs:
<ol>
  <li>
    the value in all proposal and accept messages is \(V^{*}\), and
  </li>
  <li>
  for all acceptors \(A\):
    \( (A.accept\_t < T^{*}) \vee (A.accept\_v =  V^{*}) \)
		      </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h4>
The proof is by induction on successive epochs in the sequence of
epochs that follows epoch \(T^{*}\). Let \(T^{i}\) be the time of the
\(i\)-th epoch after epoch \(T^{*}\), and let \(T^{0} = T^{*}\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case: epoch \(T^{*}\)</p>
<i>Part 1</i>: All proposals are sent by the
same proposer in an epoch, and all proposals have the same timestamp
and value. Therefore, the value in all proposal and accept messages in
epoch \(T^{*}\) is \(V^{*}\).

<p>
<i>Part 2</i>:  In epoch \(T^{*}\), \(A.accept\_t\) is changed only when 
\(A.accept\_v\) is set to \(V^{*}\), and so part 2 follows.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Induction step: epoch \(T^{i+1}\)</p>
Assume that the theorem holds for epochs \(T^{0}, T^{1}, \ldots,
T^{i}\), and prove that it holds for epoch \(T^{i+1}\).
The result is vacuously true if no proposals are sent in
   this epoch. Consider the case where proposals are sent.

   <p>
     Because  \(A.accept\_t\) is never decreased, it follows
     that in all epochs after epoch \(T^{*}\) there is a majority of
     acceptors for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). 
   <p>
     A proposer \(p\) sends a proposal only if it receives
     \(updated\_time\) messages from a majority of acceptors. Any two
     majorities have at least one element in common. So, there exists
     an acceptor \(A\) that sends an \(updated\_time\) message to
     \(p\) and for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). Because
     \(A.accept\_t\) is positive, \(A.accept\_v\) 
     is not null (see the invariants).

   <p>
     So, proposer \(p\) identifies the \(updated\_time\) message with
     the largest \(A.accept\_t\). This value is greater than or equal
     to \(T^{*}\), and so the corresponding \(A.accept\_v \) is
     \(V^{*}\), and therefore the  proposal's value is
     \(V^{*}\). So, the value of accept messages is also \(V^{*}\),
     and if \(A.accept\_v\) is changed then the new value is \(V^{*}\).


     <h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
     This example illustrates the idea underlying the proof. In the
     next diagram, proposer P0 sends a \(new\_time(T^{*})\)
     message which is received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond
     with updated time messages with timestamp \(T^{*}\). Proposer P0
     receives both messages, and sends proposals to all acceptors. In
     this case the proposals are received by A0 and A2 which then send
     accept messages. When A0 and A2 receive the proposals they set
     \(A.accept\_t, A.accept\_v = T^{*}, V^{*}\), and these values
     remain unchanged until the next proposal is received.

The diagram below shows an epoch T1 that follows epoch T0. In this
epoch, proposer P1 sends \(new\_time(T^{1})\) messages which are
received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond with updated time
messages with timestamp \(T^{1}\).
When P1 gets both messages it sends proposals to all acceptors.
Let's use the argument of the proof
to determine the value of proposals and the accept message sent by A1 in this
epoch.

    <figcaption>Fig.8: What can be proved about the next accept message?</figcaption>
</figure>


When P1 gets both updated time messages it
identifies the message with the largest value of \(A.accept\_t\). The
message sent by A0 has timestamp \(T^{*}\) whereas the message sent by
A1 has an earlier timestamp. So, the updated time message with the
largest \(A.accept\_t\) is the message sent by A0. 

P1 sends proposals with a value of
\(A0.accept\_t\) which is \(V^{*}\). The green circles show how the
value \(V^{*}\) is sent from A0 to P1 to A1.

   <p>
     We see that proposals and accept
messages have value \(V^{*}\) in the next epoch as well.

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct for
  Semi-Synchronous Trajectories</h3>
The specification of the algorithm is repeated here for convenience.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A learner doesn't change the value that it learns.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

   <p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
   The value of
<code>v</code> in every message is either null or <code>P.VALUE</code>
for some proposer P, and so part 1 follows. Parts 2 and 3 follow from
the previous theorem: if a majority of acceptors send identical
 \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) messages in an epoch, then in all succeeding
epochs, the value \(v\) of every accept message remains \(V^{*}\).


<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Paxos is Correct for
  all Trajectories</h3>

We have shown that the Paxos algorithm is correct for semi-synchronous
trajectories. Now we show the correctness of the algorithm for all
trajectories.

Let \([past(T), future(T)]\) be a cut of a timeline where \(past(T)\)
is the set of events with time \(T\) or
less. Therefore \(future(T)\) is the set of events with time greater than \(T\).

<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Consistent cuts</h4>
The cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) is consistent.

<h5  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
There is no message from an event in \(future(T)\)
to an event in \(past(T)\).

<p>
  If a proposer sends a message in the future, i.e., with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor processes the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\), and is also in the future.
      Likewise, if a proposer sends a message with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor receives the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\).

    <figcaption>Fig.8: Consistent Cuts of Paxos Trajectories</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram shows a cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) of a trajectory. The
green circles represent events in the past, and the yellow circles
represent events in the future. A little analysis shows that there are
no edges from the future to the past. (Indeed, you can show that there
are no edges from the past to the future, and so the graph can be
partitioned into independent subgraphs.)

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct</h3>
Consider any trajectory \(X\) in which a majority of acceptors accepts \((T^{*},
V^{*})\). Let \(Y\) be the semi-synchronous trajectory corresponding
to X.

From the theorem on semi-synchronous trajectories, for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(Y\) with \(T' \geq T\) have \(V' =
V^{*}\).
Because the global states are identical in \(X\) and \(Y\), for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(X\) with \(T' \geq T\) also have \(V' =
V^{*}\). Therefore if a learner receives \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) from a
majority of acceptors, and the same or another learner receives \(accept(T', V')\) from a
majority of acceptors, then \(V' = V^{*}\) and the correctness of parts 2 and 3 of the
specification follow.
