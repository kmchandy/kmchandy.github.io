    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The Paxos Algorithm</h1>
    
    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Key Idea: Consensus with Faulty
    Agents</h1>
Algorithms by which groups of agents
<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">
come to a consensus
</a>
are among the most fundamental problems in distributed computing.


    <p>
    <a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html">
    From the FLP theorem</a>, which we discussed in the earlier
    module, we 
    know that that there is no algorithm that guarantees that
    consensus among distributed agents will be reached if messages
    are delayed for arbitrary time. Next we describe an algorithm that
    enables consensus to be reached in most situations,
    though there is a possibility that
    consensus may never be reached. We can use probabalistic
    algorithms to reduce the probability of
    never reaching consensus.

    <p>
    Why is reaching consensus so important? There are many problems in
    which messages are sent to groups of agents who collectively
    maintain a common <i>consensus</i> state. A bank may use a group
    of agents, rather than a single agent, to maintain bank
    balances. Multiple agents reduce the possibility of system-wide
    failure due to the failure of a single agent.  Managing replicated
    databases requires the replications to come to a consensus on the
    sequence of transactions that is applied to the
    database. Cryptocurrency transactions also require collections of
    agents to come to a consensus about sequences of the
    transactions. In distributed control systems agents have to come
    to a consensus about the state of the environment so that they can
    operate in concert.  In some applications, multiple agents have to
    elect a single leader.
    
    <p>
    This module describes,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
<i>Paxos</i>, an important algorithm</a> by which agents in a
distributed system come to a consensus.


There are other algorithms, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)">
<i>Raft</i>
</a>
that deal with this problem;
we will describe them later.

    
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Assumptions</h3>

<p>
The Paxos algorithm deals with messages that may be lost and that may
overtake each other. Agents  may stop and restart later,
and agents  may be arbitrarily slow. By contrast, in the
algorithms that we have discussed so far, we assume that messages are
not lost; messages sent along a channel are delivered in the order
sent; and agents do not stop.


<p>
The Paxos algorithm, and most distributed algorithms studied here,
assume that messages are not modified while in transit and that agents
do not have <a href="../Byzantine/Byzantine.html">Byzantine
faults.</a>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h3>

<p>
The algorithm has agents called
<i>proposers</i> and others called <i>learners</i>. (In an
implementation an agent may play the role of both proposer and
learner.) Proposers propose values. Learners come to a consensus among
    the proposed values.

    <p>
Associated with each learner \(L\) is a local variable \(L.value\)
which is initially \(null\). Associated with each proposer \(P\) is a
local constant \(P.VALUE\) which is the value that the
proposer is proposing.
<p>
The specification has three parts.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  <p> For every learner \(L\):
  <p>
  \(
  (L.value \neq null) \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \: P : L.value = P.VALUE)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  <p>
  For all learners \(L\) and \(L'\):
  <p>
  \(
  (L.value \neq null) \wedge (L'.value \neq null) \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  ( L.value = L'.value)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>After a learner learns a value it doesn't later learn a different
  value.</i>
  <p>
  For all learners \(L\), and for all non-null values \(V\):
  <p>
  \(
  stable (L.value = V)
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">The Paxos Algorithm</h2>
The Paxos Algorithm, proposed by Leslie Lamport, has an additional
layer of agents called <i>acceptors</i>. The communication structure
between agents is shown in the figure below.

<p>

    <figcaption>Fig.1: Proposers, Acceptors and Learners</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Local Variables and Messages</h4>
In the description of the algorithm;
<br>
<i>A timestamp</i> is a pair
  <code>(n, pid)</code>, where <code>n</code> is a number
  and <code>pid</code> is the id
  of a proposer. Proposer ids are totally ordered and are used to break
ties.
<br>
<i>A value</i>
  is either <code>null</code> or <code>P.VALUE</code>
  for some proposer <code>P</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local variable and constant for proposer
<code>P</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Variable: <code>P.t</code>, timestamp)
  </li>
  <li>
  Constant: <code>P.VALUE</code>, value
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local variables for acceptor
<code>A</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <code>A.t</code>, timestamp
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.accept_v</code>, value
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>A.accept_t</code>, timestamp
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Messages</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  proposer to acceptors: <i>new_time</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  acceptor replies: <i>updated_time</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  proposer to acceptors: <i>proposal</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  acceptors to learners: <i>accept</i>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Learners</h4>
The algorithm for learners is simple:
A learner determines that the consensus value is <code>V</code> if the
learner receives <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages from a majority of
acceptors with identical values of <code>(T, V)</code>.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm for Proposers and Acceptors</h3>

<p>
The algorithm for proposers and acceptors is given below.

<pre>
//Initial values:
For all acceptors A:
     A.t = 0
     A.accept_v, A.accept_t = null, 0
For all proposers P:
     P.t = 0
  
// Proposer P. Step P.1. Send new_time to acceptors
P.t = P.t + any positive value
send new_time(P.t) to all acceptors

// Acceptor A. Step A.1. Send updated_time to proposers
upon receiving new_time(t) from any proposer P:
   if t > A.t:
      A.t = t
      send updated_time(A.t, A.accept_v, A.accept_t) to P

// Proposer P. Step P.2. Send proposal to acceptors
wait to receive updated_time(t, accept_v, accept_t) messages from a
     majority of acceptors where t == P.t:
     if accept_v is null for all of these messages:
         send proposal(P.t, P.VALUE) to all acceptors
     else:
         v_max_accept_t =  the accept_v field of the updated_time message
                          with the largest accept_t field
         send proposal(P.t, v_max_accept_t) to all acceptors
      
// Acceptor A. Step A.2. Send accept to learners
upon receiving proposal(t, v) from P:
    if t >= A.t:
       A.t = t
       A.accept_t, A.accept_v = t, v
       send accept(A.accept_t, A.accept_v) to all learners
</pre>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm Steps</h4>
The algorithm has only one point where an agent waits: Step P.2.
In step P.2, a proposer waits for a bounded time
to receive promise messages from a majority of acceptors. If these
messages don't arrive within this time then the proposer aborts this
iteration and starts the next iteration, i.e. back to step P.1,
without completing step P.2.

<p>
A proposer repeatedly executes a loop consisting of steps P.1 and P.2.
For the time being assume that the loop never terminates; we will
discuss termination later.
Acceptors respond to messages that they receive from proposers.

<p>
In the discussion, we refer to <code>P.t</code> and <code>A.t</code> as <code>P</code>'s
timestamp and <code>A</code>'s timestamp, respectively. And we refer
to <code>A.accept_v</code> as the value accepted by <code>A</code>,
and we call <code>A.accept_t</code> as the timestamp of the value
accepted by <code>A</code>.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Observations about the Algorithm</h4>
The following observations are helpful in understanding the algorithm.
<ol>
  <li>
  <p class="w3-text-teal">Ignored messages can be treated as lost</p>
  In step A.1 if <code>t < A.t</code>, and in step A.2 if <code>t <= A.t</code>, the
  message received by the acceptor is ignored. In step P.2, an
  <code>updated_time</code> message received by a proposer
  <code>P</code> is ignored
  if the <code>time</code> component of the message is different from
  <code>P.t</code>
  A lost message has exactly the same impact as an ignored message.
  We can treat all ignored messages as lost because they do not change
  variables or messages.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="w3-text-teal">A proposer's timestamp never decreases</p>
  The only change to <code>P.t</code> is in step P.1, and this change
  increases <code>P.t</code>. So, <code>P.t</code> never decreases:
  <p>
  <code>
  for all P, T: stable(P.t > T)
  </code>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="w3-text-teal">An acceptor's timestamp never decreases</p>
  The changes to <code>A.t</code> in steps A.1 and A.2
  increase <code>A.t</code>. So, <code>A.t</code> never decreases:
  <p>
  <code>
  for all A, T: stable(A.t > T)
  </code>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="w3-text-teal"><code>A.accept_t <= A.t</code></p>
  The only step at which <code>A.accept_t, A.accept_v</code> is
  modified is step
  A.2 where
  <br><code>A.t = A.accept_t</code>.
  <p>
  Because
  <code>A.t</code> never decreases, we can prove the invariant:
  <br>
  <code>
  A.accept_t <= A.t
  </code>
  </li>
  <li>
  The next assertion deals only with messages that are received.
  It does not deal with messages that are lost or ignored.
  <i>
  Upon receiving a message with timestamp T an acceptor or proposer
  sets its timestamp to T or greater.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
The figure below shows a system timeline with 3 acceptors and 2
proposers. Timelines for learners are not shown. The events on the
timeline are: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>N(t)</i>: A proposer sends <code>new_time(t)</code> message, and
  the proposer's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>U(t)</i>: An acceptor replies to the proposer with a
  <code>updated_time(t, accept_v, accept_t)</code> message, and 
  the acceptor's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>P(t)</i>: A proposer responds with a
  <code>proposal(t, v)</code> message, and the proposer's timestamp at
  this event is <code>t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A(t)</i>: An acceptor accepts a proposer's
  <code>proposal(t, v)</code> by 
  sending a
  <code>accept(accept_v, accept_t)</code> message to learners, and 
  the acceptor's timestamp when it sends the message is
  <code>t</code>. The accept messages to learners are not shown.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the diagram, <code>new_time</code> messages are grey,
<code>updated_time</code> messages are purple, and
<code>proposals</code> are black. The <code>new_time(t)</code> message
sent by proposer P0 to acceptor A2 is lost, and the the <code>proposal</code> sent
by P0 to acceptor A1 is lost.

    <figcaption>Fig.2: Timelines</figcaption>
</figure>
  
<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Events with larger timestamps can appear earlier than events with
smaller timestamps in a timeline, as shown in the figure below.

<figure>
    <img src="PaxosFigures/PaxosFigures.013.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Timestamps appearing out of order</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The proof of the algorithm is based on the
<a href="../ChannelSnapshots/Timelines.html">
<i>Theorem about Permutation of Event Sequences</i>
in timelines.
</a>
  
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Permutation of Event Sequences</h2>
Given any system timeline \(X\) for the Paxos algorithm there exists a
system timeline \(Y\) where (1) agent timelines and messages in \(X\) and \(Y\) are
identical and (2) messages
are received only after they are sent and (3)
<br>
<i>
events in \(Y\) appear in order of their timestamps.
</i>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
(Same proof as in <a
href="../ChannelSnapshots/Timelines.html">timelines.</a>)
<p>
If events are not in order of timestamps in a timeline then there exist consecutive
events \(e, e'\) in the timeline where \(e\) has a larger timestamp
than \(e'\) does. We will prove that flipping the order of events
gives a timeline for the same system.
<p>
From observation 5, if there is a path in the timeline diagram from \(e\) to \(e'\) then
the timestamp for \(e'\) is greater than or equal to the timestamp fo
\(e\). Because \(e\) has a larger timestamp than \(e'\) does, there is
no path in timeline diagram from \(e\) to \(e'\).
<p>
There is no path in timeline diagram from \(e'\) to \(e\) because
\(e'\) appears after \(e\).
Because there are no paths between \(e\) and \(e'\), they are
independent, and flipping their order does not change messages or
variables in the timeline.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Timestamp-Ordered Events</h2>
We will reason about values of messages and variables in any timeline
by reasoning about an equivalent timeline (same agent timelines, same
messages) in which events appear in order of timestamps.

<figure>
    <img src="PaxosFigures/PaxosFigures.014.jpeg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Timestamp-Ordered Events</figcaption>
</figure>

The figure above shows timeline with events ordered by timestamps. The
timeline can be partitioned into a sequence of intervals where all
events in an interval have identical timestamps. We call an
interval in which all events have timestamp \(t\) a <i>\(t\)-epoch</i>.
<p>
In the diagram, the circles represent events. Reddish brown circles
represent events with timestamp \(t^{0}\), blue circles
represent events with timestamp \(t^{1}\), and green circles
represent events with timestamp \(t^{2}\) where:
<br>
\(t^{0} < t^{1} < t^{2} < \ldots \)
<p>
This timeline shows three epochs with timestamps \(t^{0}, t^{1}, t^{2}\).

<p>
The event in which an acceptor sends an <code>accept(t,
v)</code> message is called an <code>accepts (t, v)</code> event.
Likewise, the event in which a proposer sends a <code>proposal(v,
t)</code> message is called a <code>proposes(t, v)</code> event.
Working with events ordered in timestamps makes understanding the
algorithm much clearer.

<p>
In the following theorems, we consider timelines in which events occur in the order of
timestamps. From the theorem on permutations of event sequences the
values of variables and messages are the same as in any timeline.


<h2  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h2>
If a majority of acceptors accepts a value v* in any epoch then all
proposed and accepted values in that and subsequent epochs remains v*.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h4>
We prove the theorem by induction on the sequence of epochs that
follow the epoch in which a a majority of acceptors accept value
v*. Let this epoch be the t*-epoch.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Base Case: Epoch t*</h4>
An acceptor accepts \((t*, v*)\) only if a proposer P proposes \((t*,
v*)\) --- see step A.2. Proposer P sends the <i>same proposal</i> to all
acceptors in an epoch --- see step P.2. Therefore if P
proposes \((t*, v*)\) and also proposes (t*, v')\) then \(v' =
v*\). So, every value proposed in epoch \(t*\) is the same --- \(v*\) --- and
therefore every value accepted in this epoch is also \(v*\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Induction Step</h4>
Let \(t^{0}\) be \(t*\) and let the timestamps of subsequent epochs in
increasing order be \(t^{1}, t^{2}, t^{3}, \ldots \).
Assume that the theorem holds for epochs \(t^{i}\) where \(0 \leq i <
k\) and prove the theorem for \(i = k\).
So, every value proposed or accepted in epochs \(t^{0} \ldots,
t^{k-1}\) is the same --- \(v*\).
<p>
A proposer P proposes a value in epoch \(t^{k}\) only after receiving 
<code>updated_time</code> messages from a majority of acceptors in that
epoch. Any two majorities have at least one element in
common. Therefore, at least one of the <code>updated_time</code>
messages received by P have <code>accept_t</code> = \(t^{k}\), and
<code>accept_v</code> = \(v*\). P executes step P.2 of the algorithm
and sets <code>v_max_accept_t</code> to \(v*\); so, the value it
proposes is \(v*\).
<p>
Since every value proposed in epochs after \(t^{0}\) is \(v*\), it
follows that every value accepted in these epochs is also \(v*\).

<h2  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct</h2>
The specification of the algorithm is repeated here for convenience.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>After a learner learns a value it doesn't later learn a different
  value.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

<p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
We prove that part 1 is invariant by observing that the value of
<code>v</code> in every message is either null or <code>P.VALUE</code>
for some proposer P.
<p>
After a majority of acceptors accept a value <code>v*</code>, every
value that is accepted is the same: <code>v*</code>. Therefore, <i>every</i>
majority of acceptors that accepts <code>(t, v)</code> has <code>v =
v*</code>. So, all learners learn <code>v*</code>.
<p>
The proof of part 3 is the same as that of part 2. Since the value
accepted by all majorities of acceptors is the same, the value learned
does not change.
<p>
Our proof is for timelines with events ordered by timestamps. What if
events are not in timestamp order? The theorem on permutation of event
sequences tells us that the values of variables and messages for
unordered timelines are the same as for ordered timelines. The
correctness of Paxos depends only on the values learned, and not on
when they were learned.


<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Paxos may not Terminate</h4>
There are many scenarios in which the algorithm does not
terminate. For example, suppose proposer P0 generates even timestamps,
0, 2, 4, ... and proposer P1 generates odd timestamps, 1, 3, 5,...
The two proposers may interfere so that no epoch runs to
completion. Before a majority of acceptors respond to a timestamp, a
message with a higher timestamp arrives.
<p>
To obtain rapid termination, with high probability, we need an epoch
to run all the way to completion --- a majority of acceptors accept a
value. One way to reduce the likelihood that an epoch will start
before an earlier one completes is to use probability and exponential
backoff.
