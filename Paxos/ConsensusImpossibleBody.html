This module discusses the importance of achieving consensus among
distributed agents and describes the central ideas of a proof that achieving
consensus among agents, one of which may be faulty, is impossible.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Importance of Consensus</h3>

<p>
Algorithms by which groups of agents <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">
come to a consensus </a> are among the most fundamental problems in
distributed computing.

<p>
Why is consensus important? There are many
problems in which messages are sent to groups of agents who
collectively maintain a common <i>consensus</i> state. A bank may use
a group of agents, rather than a single agent, to maintain bank
balances. Multiple agents reduce the possibility of system-wide
failure due to the failure of a single agent.  Managing replicated
databases requires the replications to come to a consensus on the
sequence of transactions that is applied to the
database. Cryptocurrency transactions also require collections of
agents to come to a consensus about sequences of the transactions.

<p>
In a control system with multiple and actuators, the actuators have to
come to a consensus about the state of the environment so that they
can operate in concert. A vehicle would crash if some actuators caused
the vehicle to accelerate while other actuators applied brakes.  In
some applications, multiple agents have to elect a single leader.
There are many problems in which a collection of agents have to come
to a <i>consensus</i> about something.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Consensus: Impossible with a
    faulty agent</h3>
    Consensus is impossible with even a single faulty agent. This was
    proved in a paper published by Fischer, Lynch and Patterson.

    <p>
    You can get the idea of why consensus is not possible by
    considering the following problem in which
    when message delays are finite but arbitrarily long.
    A collection of 2N + 1 agents want to
    come to a consensus about a color. N of the agents pick blue and
    N+1 pick red. One of the red agents is arbitrarily slow. The
    2N non-slow agents exchange messages among each other, and each of
    these 2N agents gets N votes for red and N votes for blue. Agents
    decide to take a majority vote, and in the event of a tie pick
    blue.

    <p>
    How long should they wait for the slow agent?

    <p>
    Consider an algorithm in which agent waits until its local clock
    shows an elapsed time of T and then makes a decision based on the
    votes that it has.  An agent Y gets N red and N blue votes when
    its clock shows an elapsed time of T, and agent Y decides that the
    consensus is blue. Another agent Z has a slower clock and gets a
    red vote from the slow agent for a total of N+1 red votes, before
    Z's clock shows an elapsed time of T. So Z determines that the
    consensus is red. The algorithm fails because Y and Z have not
    come to a consensus. 

<p>
No algorithm is guaranteed to come to a consensus in finite time if
messages can be arbitrarily slow or if agents can be arbitrarily slow.
Systems with synchronized clocks don't have this particular
problem. We'll look at consensus in such systems later.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Best Effort Consensus</h3>
The theorem says that there is no algorithm that guarentees that
consensus can be reached in all scenarios; 
however, consensus can be reached in most practical situations. An idea
to overcome the counterexample given above is:
Agents keep trying repeatedly until they reach consensus. The theorem tells us
that the agents may have to keep trying for ever. We expect, however,
that in most practical situations their attempts will succeed at some point.

<p>
What does keep trying mean? When does one trial
end and the next one begin? If agents use timeouts to end a trial,
then --- because clocks aren't synchronized --- the timeouts may complete
at different times.
We'll see that we can use the idea of time, even though clocks aren't
synchronized. We've done that before with logical clocks. The Paxos
algorithm shows how the idea of increasing values of timestamps (or
ids) are used for best-effort consensus.

<ol>
  <li>
  The proof considers messages with arbitrary delay. Suppose you had a
  system in which a message was either lost or delivered with a delay
  of at most T seconds. If all agents had accurate real-time (as
  opposed to logical) clocks, could the agents reach a consensus? What
  algorithms would you use?
  </li>
  <li>
  If there were an algorithm that enabled a collection of agents to
  come to a consensus, then could the algorithm be used to construct a
  distributed ledger? The ledger would contain a sequence of
  transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. Agents would propose
  transactions and the algorithm would create a total order (a
  sequence) of these transactions. Would that work? Could the idea be
  used to create a cryptocurrency without a bank or other single
  trusted agent?
