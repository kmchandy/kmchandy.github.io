  (3) Timelines in which events occur in rounds.

  <p class="w3-text-red">

  This page describes
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">
  <i>Paxos</i>
  </a>,
  an algorithm by which agents come to a consensus about a value from
  a set of proposed values. 

  Paxos enables consensus to be reached in most situations, though
  there is a possibility that the algorithm may not terminate.

  </p>
  <p>
 
  
  From
  <a href="../ConsensusImpossible/ConsensusImpossible.html">the
  FLP theorem</a>,
  
  there is no algorithm that guarantees that consensus among agents
  will be reached if messages can be lost and delayed and agents may
  fail and be arbitrarily slow. 

  Paxos may not terminate though it enables consensus to be reached in
  most situations.

  
  <!-------------------------------------------------->
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h3>

  The algorithm assumes that messages are not modified in transit and agents
  do not exhibit Byzantine behavior -- agents may be arbitrarily slow,
  they may stop and restart, but they otherwise obey the protocol.

  <p> A system has agents called <i>proposers</i> and agents called
  <i>learners</i>.

  Proposers propose values and learners come to a consensus among the
  proposed values. 

    <p>
Each learner \(L\) has a local variable \(L.v\) 
  which is initially \(null\).
  If \(L.v\) becomes any non-null value \(w\) then we
  say that \(L\) has learned \(w\).

  Associated with each proposer \(P\) is a
local constant \(P.V\) which is its proposed value. The specification
 of the algorithm is that the 
 following conditions must always hold.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Learners learn only proposed values.
  <br>
  \(\forall \; \textrm{learners} \;  L: \quad
  (L.v = null) \; \vee \;
  (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \: P : L.v = P.V)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  A learner doesn't change a value that it learns.
  <br>
  \(
  \forall \; \textrm{learners} \; L, V \neq null: \quad stable (L.v = V)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  All learners learn the same value.
  <br>
  \(
  \forall \; \textrm{learners} \; L, L': \quad
  (L.v = null) \vee (L'.v = null) \vee 
  ( L.v = L'.v)
  \)
  </li>
</ol>
The specification allows for the possibility that
consensus may never be reached; a learner may never learn a value. 


<!------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction of Acceptors</h4>

The algorithm uses agents called <i>acceptors</i> in addition to
proposers and learners. 

Each acceptor <i>A</i> has two local variables, <i>A.v</i> and
<i>A.t</i>, where <i>A.v</i> is either a special symbol null or a
proposer's value, and <i>A.t</i> is a number. \(A.v\) and \(A.t\) are
called \(A\)'s value and \(A\)'s timestamp, respectively.

<p>
Let \(N\) be the number of acceptors, and \(M\) be an integer where
\(M \geq N/2\). A majority of
acceptors is a set of \(M\) or more acceptors.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Basic Consensus</h3>
  Before describing Paxos, we specify a subproblem, called
  <i>basic consensus</i> that is solved in Paxos. Basic consensus is
specified in terms of proposers and acceptors without learners.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Specification of Basic Consensus</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
Acceptor values are proposer values or \(null\).
<p>
\(
(\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \; P: A.v = P.v) \vee (A.v = null)
\)
</li>
<li>
If there exists a majority \(S\) of acceptors and there eixsts \(v*
  \neq null\) and \(t*\) such that for all acceptors \(C\) in \(S\),
  there is a point in the computation at which
  <p>
  \(
  C.v, C.t = v*,  t*
  \)
  <p>
  then at all points in the computation, every acceptor has 
value \(v*\) or timestamps less than \(t*\).

<p>

\(
\forall \; \textrm{acceptors} \; A: \;
  (A.v = v*)  \vee (A.t < t*)
\)

</li>
</ol>

Before giving a distributed algorithm for basic consensus we analyze a
for-loop in a sequential algorithm. The sequential algorithm gives
insight into the distributed version.

<!------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">A Sequential Simulation of the Basic
Consensus Algorithm</h4>

The sequential program consists of a for-loop with loop index \(t\).

Initially, \(A.v, A.t = null, 0\) for all acceptors \(A\).

The loop does not terminate:

<pre>
for t = 0 to infinity:
   loop_body
</pre>

The loop_body is given next.

In the loop, agents are treated as shared variables.

For example, the loop body reads and writes \(A.v, A.t\) of an
acceptor \(A\).

<p>
The loop body selects an arbitrary proposer, and
arbitrary subsets of acceptors and learners; these selections simulate
nondeterminism and faults in the distributed system.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Loop Body of the Basic Consensus Algorithm</h5>
The loop body for the \(t\)-th iteration is as follows.

<p>
  Select an arbitrary proposer \(P\), and arbitrary subsets \(R, W\) of
  acceptors.
<ol>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is not a majority, take no action.
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is a majority, and for all \(A\) in \(R\): \(A.v = null\) ,
  then assign \((P.v, t)\) to each acceptor in \(W\).
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is a majority, and there is an acceptor \(A\) in \(R\)
  where \(A.v \neq null\) then
  assign  \((B.value, t)\) to each acceptor in \(W\)
  where \(B\) is an element of \(R\) with the largest
  timestamp:
  \(
  B.t = \textrm{max}(\{A.t | A \in R\})
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

A Python version of the loop body, given \(P, R, W\), where \(R,
W\) are lists, is as follows.

<pre>
if len(R) >= M:
   if all(r.v == null for r in R): next_v = P.v
   else:
      max_t = max(r.t for r in R)
      list_v = [r.v for r in R if r.t == max_t]
      // next_v is any element of list_v. 
      next_v = list_v[0]
   for w in W: w.v, w.t = next_v, t
</pre>


<!-------------------------------------------->
<h4 style="color:red;">Example of Sequential Algorithm for Basic Consensus</h4>
This example has acceptors A0, A1, A2 and two proposers with values X
and Y. Each row of the table shows the values of variables on the
\(t\)-th iteration where \(t = 0\) represents initial conditions. The
symbol <i>-</i> is used instead of \(null\).

<pre>
t   P.v   R      W      A0         A1         A2
0   -     -      -      (-, 0)     (-, 0)     (-, 0)
1   X     0      0,1    (-, 0)     (-, 0)     (-, 0)
2   X     0,1    1      (-, 0)     (X, 2)     (-, 0)
3   Y     0,2    0      (Y, 3)     (X, 2)     (-, 0)
4   Y     1,2    2      (Y, 3)     (X, 2)     (X, 4)
5   X     0,1    0,2    (Y, 5)     (X, 2)     (Y, 5)
6   X     1,2    1      (Y, 5)     (Y, 6)     (Y, 5)
7   X     0,1    2      (Y, 5)     (Y, 6)     (Y, 7)
8   X     1      1,2    (Y, 5)     (Y, 8)     (Y, 8)
</pre>

The columns with headings \(P.v, R, W\) specify the proposer, and
subsets of acceptors that are read, \(R\), and written, \(W\). For
example, on iteration 1, \(P.v = X\), \(R = \{0\}\), \(W = \{0,1\}\). The
values of the acceptors at the end of iteration \(i\) are shown in the row
where \(t = i\).

<p style="color:red;">Points to Note in the Example</p>
The majority of \(A.v\) for acceptors \(A\) after iteration 4 is \(X\)
because \(A1, A2 = (X, 2), (X, 4)\). The final majority, however, is
\(Y\); see row 6.

<p>
In row 4, \(A1.t \neq A2.t\), and that's why the majority value does
not remain \(X\).
In row 5, the majority of acceptors have identical \(A.v\)
<i>and</i> \(A.t\), and so, from row 5 onwards, the acceptor with the
largest timestamp has value \(Y\).


<!-------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness of the Sequential
Algorithm</h4>

The proof of the invariance of part 1 -- for each acceptor \(A\),
\(A.v\) is either null or \(P.v\) for some proposer \(P\) -- is
straightforward. Next, we prove part 2.

<p>
Consider the case where at the end of the \(k\)-th iteration, there is
a majority S of acceptors, and there exists \(v* \neq null\), such
that for all \(B\) in \(S\):
<p>
\(
B.v, B.t = v*, k
\)
<p>
Then, at the end of the \(k\)-th iteration, an acceptor has value
\(v*\) or it has an earlier timestamp : 
<p>
for all acceptors \(A\):
\(
  ( A.v = v*) \vee (A.t < k)
\).

<p>
We will show that this condition holds at the end of the \(k+1\)-th 
iteration. Let's go through each of the statements in the loop
body.

<ol>
  <li> Statement 1: If \(R\) is not a majority then the state remains
  unchanged, and so the condition continues to hold.
  </li>
  <li>
  Statement 2: If \(R\) is a majority then there exists an element
  common to \(S\) and \(R\), and so all the elements of \(R\) are not
  null. Therefore statement 2 does not change the state, and so the
  condition continues to hold.
  </li>
  <li>
  Statement 3: Because the condition holds before execution of
  statement 3, an element \(B\) in \(R\) with the largest timestamp is
  a member of \(S\) and therefore \(B.v, B.t = v*, k\).
  
  So, if \(A\) changes value in the \(k+1\)-th iteration then
  \(A.v = v*\), and so the condition continues to hold.
  </li>
</ol>



<!------------------------------------->

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Synchronous Distributed Algorithm for Basic
Consensus</h3>
Next we give a distributed algorithm in which proposers and agents
exchange messages.

<p>
This algorithm operates in rounds where all messages received in round
k are sent in round k.

The first field of messages sent in round k have value k to identify the
round in which the message is sent.

Later, we descibe ways in which rounds are implemented.

Messages may get lost and agents may fail.

The steps of round \(k\) are as follows.

<p>


The names of messages -- <code>prepare</code>, <code>promise</code>,
<code>accept</code> -- are names from the Paxos paper.

The reason for these names will become clear later.

<ol>
  <li>
  A round starts with the selection of a single proposer.
  Later, we describe how the proposer is selected.
  The proposer selected on the \(k\)-th round sends a message
  <code>prepare(k)</code> to all acceptors.
  </li>
  <li>
  Each acceptor \(A\) that receives the <code>prepare(k)</code>
  messages sends a reply <code>promise(k, A.v, A.t)</code> to the
  proposer. 
  </li>
  <li>
  If the proposer receives <code>promise</code> messages from a
  majority of acceptors then the  proposer sends <code>accept(k,
  value)</code> messages to all acceptors where
  <code>value</code> is determined as specified the sequential
  algorithm. 
  </li>
  <li>
  If an acceptor \(A\) receives an <code>accept(k, value)</code>
  message then it sets \(A.v, A.t = value, k\).
  </li>
</ol>

<!------------------------------------->
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Equivalence of Sequential and Synchronous
Distributed Algorithms</h5>

Messages may get lost and so the proposer receives
<code>promise</code> from a subset \(R\) of acceptors, and likewise, a
subset \(W\) of acceptors receive <code>accept</code> messages.

<ol>
  <li>
  Reading <code>A.v, A.t</code> from acceptors \(A\) in \(R\)
  in the sequential algorithm is equivalent to receiving 
<code>promise(k, A.v, A.t)</code> from \(R\) in the distributed
  algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
  Assigning <code>B.v, B.t = v*, k</code> to each acceptor \(B\) in
  \(W\) is equivalent to the proposer sending <code>accept(k,
  value)</code> messages and an acceptor \(A\) updating its value when
  it receives the message.
  </li>
</ol>

The proof of correctness of the sequential algorithm can be used for
the proof for the synchronous distributed algorithm.

<!---------------------------------------->
<h1>OLD</h1>
<H1>OLD</H1>
<H1>OLD</H1>
<H1>OLD</H1>

The system is faulty. When a proposer reads acceptors it may read only
an arbitrary subset \(R\) of acceptors. Likewise, when a proposer assigns a
value, only a subset \(W\) of acceptors may be assigned that value while
acceptors not in this subset remain unchanged.

\(R\) and \(W\) can be any subset including the empty set.

<p>
  Associated with each proposer \(P\) is a constant \(P.value\).
Each acceptor \(A\) has two fields: \(A.value\)
and \(A.timestamp\) where timestamps are integers. The specification
is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
Acceptor values are proposer values or a special symbol
  \(null\).
<p>
\(
(A.value = null) \vee (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \; P: A.value =
P.value)
\)
</li>
<li>
If there exists a value, \(value*\), and a timestamp, \(timestamp*\), and a
  majority \(S\) of acceptors
  such that for all acceptors \(C\) in \(S\), there is a point at
  which
  <p>
  \(
  C.value, C.timestamp = value*,  timestamp*
  \)
  <p>
  then all acceptors \(A\) with timestamps at least \(timestamp*\) have
  value \(value*\).
<p>

  \(
  A.timestamp \geq timestamp* \quad \Rightarrow \quad A.value = value*
  \)

<p>
Next let's look at a loop, <i>for t = 0 to infinity</i>, that represents
an infinite computation, and that solves the basic consensus
problem.

The loop body for the \(t\)-th iteration is as follows.


<ol>
  <li>
  Select an arbitrary proposer \(P\), and an arbitrary subset \(R\) of
  acceptors. 
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is not a majority, take no action.
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is a majority, and \(A.v = null\) for all \(A\) in \(R\),
  then assign \((P.v, t)\) to each acceptor in a subset of acceptors.
  </li>
  <li>
  If \(R\) is a majority, and there is an acceptor \(A\) in \(R\)
  where \(A.v \neq null\) then
  assign  \((B.value, t)\) to each acceptor in a subset of acceptors
  where \(B\) is an element of \(R\) with the largest
  timestamp in \(R\), i.e.,
  \(
  B.t = \textrm{max}(\{A.t | A \in R\})
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

    
<pre>
P = arbitrary proposer
R = arbitrary subset of acceptors
W = arbitrary subset of acceptors

//(1) No action if R is not a majority
if len(R) >= M:

   // (2) If all values of elements in R are null
   // then next_v becomes P.v
   if all(r.v == null for r in R): next_v = P.v

   else:
      // (3) At least one element of R is not null.
      // next_v is any element r of R with the maximum
      // r.t
      max_t = max(r.t for r in R)
      next_v = r.v for any r in R where r.t == max_t

   // (4) All elements of w become (next_v, t)
   for w in W: w.v, w.t = next_v, t
</pre>
  







  A system has a set \(P\)
  of agents called \(proposers\) and a set \(acceptors\) of shared
  variables that all proposers 
  can access.

  A proposer's operations are to read all acceptor values, or
assign the same value to all acceptors.
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Acceptors</h4> 
The algorithm uses agents called <i>acceptors</i> in addition to
proposers and learners. 

Each acceptor <i>A</i> has two local variables, <i>A.v</i> and <i>A.vt</i>,
where <i>A.v</i> is either a special symbol null or a proposer's value, and <i>A.vt</i>
is a number. We call \(A.v\) \(A\)'s value, and \(A.vt\) \(A\)'s
timestamp. 

<p>
Let \(N\) be the number of acceptors, and \(M\) be an integer where
\(M \geq N/2\). A set of \(M\) or more acceptors is a majority of
acceptors.

<p>
Let's first design an algorithm with acceptors and without learners
that solves a simpler problem with the following specification.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Specification for Acceptors</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
  An acceptor's value is the value of a proposer or is a
  special symbol \(null\).
  <p>
  \(
  (A.v = null) \vee (\exists \; \textrm{proposer} \; P: A.v = P.V)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  If there exists a majority \(S\), and \(v*, vt*\)
  such that for each acceptor \(C\) in \(S\) there is a point at
  which
  <p>
  \(
  (C.v = v*) \wedge (c.vt = vt*)
  \)
  <p>
  then for all points in the computation, for all acceptors \(A\):
  <p>
  \(
  [A.vt \geq vt* \; \Rightarrow \; A.v = v*]
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
If a majority <i>S</i> of acceptors have identical local
variables at any point in a computation then from that point onwards
there exists a majority <i>S'</i> of acceptors with identical local
  variables, and
  </li>
  <li>
  If <i>v*</i>  is the value of agents in <i>S</i> then 
  <i>v*</i>  is the value of agents in <i>S'</i>


Then from that point onwards
there exists a majority of acceptors with identical local variables
and the value of agents in the majority remains <i>v*</i>.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Basic Consensus</h2>
We first discuss a simple <i>for</i> loop that provides insight into
Paxos.

The loop has a set of variables called <i>acceptors</i>.
Each acceptor <i>A</i> has two fields, <i>A.v</i> and <i>A.vt</i>,
where <i>A.v</i> is a value and <i>A.vt</i> is a number which represents the
time at which <i>A.v</i> last changed value.

<p>
The loop is <i>for i = 0 to infinity do loop_body</i>, where the loop
body is as follows:
<ol>
  <li>
  select: an arbitrary proposer <i>p</i>, and arbitrary subsets
  <i>read_values, write_values, update_values</i> of acceptors.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the <i>read_values</i> is not at least a majority of acceptors
  then skip this iteration.
  <pre>
  if |read_values| < M: skip.
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  The iteration continues when <i>read_values</i> is at least a
  majority.
  <br>
  If r.v is null for all r in <i>read_values</i>
  

In
the loop 
<pre>
select: an arbitrary proposer p,
select arbitrary subsets R, W of acceptors

if |R| >= M:
  if r.v = null for all r in R :
     next_v = p.v
  else:
     max_t = max(r.t for r in R)
     next_v = r.v where r is any element of R
         such that r.t = max_t

  for all w in W: w.v, w.t = next_v, t
  </pre>
           
     



  A system has a set of agents called <i>proposers</i> and a set of
  shared variables called <i>acceptors</i>. Associated with each
  proposer <i>P</i> is a value <i>P.v</i>. An acceptor <i>A</i>
  is a tuple (<i>A.v, A.t</i>) where
  <ol>
    <li>
    <i>A.v</i> is either a special symbol <i>null</i> or is the value
    <i>P.v</i> of some proposer <i>P</i>, and
    </li>
    <li>
    <i>A.t</i> is a nonnegative integer representing the time at
    which <i>A</i> was last modified.
    </li>
 </ol>
Initially  all acceptors are (null, 0).
  <p>
  Let <i>N</i> be the number of acceptors, and let <i>M</i> be the
  smallest integer greater than <i>N/2</i>. A set of <i>M</i>
 acceptors  is a majority.

 
<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</h3>
The algorithm has an additional
layer of agents called <i>acceptors</i> in addition to proposers and
learners. The communication structure 
between agents is shown in the figure below. Proposers send and
receive messages from acceptors.

Learners receive messages from
acceptors, and do not send messages to proposers or
acceptors. We postpone discussion of learners, and begin by focusing
on interactions between proposers and acceptors.

<p>

    <figcaption>Fig.1: Proposers, Acceptors and Learners</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local Variables</p>
In the description of the algorithm; a
<i>time</i> is a pair
  <code>(n, pid)</code>, where <code>pid</code>
    is the id
  of a proposer, and <code>n</code> and <code>pid</code> are integers
(or any total order).
A <i>value</i> is either <code>null</code> or
<code>P.VALUE</code> where <code>P</code> is a proposer.


We use symbols <code>P</code>, <code>A</code>,
<code>t</code> and <code>v</code> for proposer, acceptor, time and
value.

<p>
A proposer <code>P</code> has the following
local variables.
<ul>
<li>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm Steps</h4>
The algorithm has only one point where an agent waits: step P.2
In this step a proposer <code>P</code> waits for a bounded time
to receive promise messages from a majority of acceptors
where the timestamp of each of these messages is <code>P.t</code>.
If these
messages don't arrive within this time then the proposer aborts this
iteration and starts the next iteration, i.e. back to step P.1,
without completing step P.2.
Note that the value of <code>P.t</code> in step P.2
is the same as its value at the end of step P.1.

<p>
A proposer repeatedly executes a loop consisting of steps P.1 and P.2.
For the time being assume that the loop never terminates.


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
The figure below shows events in a single epoch in a system timeline with 3 acceptors and 2
proposers. Timelines for learners are not shown. All events in the
same epoch have the same timestamps. We use T for this timestamp
common to all events in the epoch.

<p>
The legends for events in the diagram are: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>prep(t)</i>: A proposer <code>P</code> sends <code>prepare(T)</code> message, where
  <code>t</code> is the proposer's timestamp <code>P.t</code> at the
  point at which <code>P</code> sends the message, and <code>T =
  P.t</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>prom(T, -, -)</i>: An acceptor <code>A</code> replies to the proposer with a
  <code>promise(T, accept_v, accept_t)</code> message, where
  <code>T</code> is the timestamp that <code>A</code> received in the
  <code>prepare(T)</code> message.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>accept(T, _)</i>: A proposer sends <code>accept(T, v)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A(t)</i>: An acceptor accepts
  <code>accept(T, v)</code> message in step A.2
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the diagram, <code>new_time</code> messages are grey,
<code>updated_time</code> messages are purple, and
<code>proposals</code> are black. The <code>new_time(t)</code> message
sent by proposer P0 to acceptor A2 is lost, and the the <code>proposal</code> sent
by P0 to acceptor A1 is lost.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Sync Times</p>
<code>P.t</code> and <code>A.t</code> are the <i>sync times of agents
<code>P</code> and <code>A</code></i>, respectively.
We call <code>A.accept_v</code> and <code>A.accept_t</code> the 
<i>value accepted</i> and the <i>sync time of the value accepted</i> by
<code>A</code>, respectively.
In messages <code>prepare(t)</code>, <code>promise(t, -, -)</code>, and 
<code>accept(t, -)</code>, <code>t</code> is the <i>sync time
of the message</i>.

<hr class="new2">
<p style="color:blue;">
Sync time property: The sync-time of a sender of a message
is the same as the sync-time of a receiver of that message.
</p>
<hr class="new2">

<p>Proof</p>
For every step of the algorithm:
the sync time of a message sent is the same as the sync time of the
sender at the point at which the message is sent, and
the sync time of a receiver of a message is the
same as the sync time of the message.

<p>
A consequence of the sync time property is the following.
Let \(X\) be the sequence of events in a given trajectory of the Paxos
algorithm. Let \(Y\) be a permutation of \(X\) where the timeline of
each agent is the same in \(X\) and \(Y\) and events in \(Y\) are executed in
increasing order of sync time. For all \(T\), the state of an agent when its sync
time is \(T\) is the same in \(X\) and \(Y\). Therefore we can reason
about agent states in \(X\) by reasoning about them in \(Y\).

<p>Partition the timeline of \(Y\) into
epochs where all events in an epoch have the same sync time.
We can analyze \(Y\) as a sequence of state transitions from the start
of an epoch to the start of the next epoch. Channels are empty at the
start of each epoch. So, these epoch-level state
transitions deal only with agent states.




<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Synchronous trajectories</h4>
We prove that the synchronous trajectory Y satisfies the Paxos
specifications. 

<p>
Sync times are pairs (integer, process id). So, identical sync times
have the same process id. Therefore all sync times in an epoch
also have the same process id. From the algorithm, this process id is
the id of the proposer that sends the <code>prepare</code> message.
Therefore, all events in an epoch are a consequence of
<code>prepare</code> messages sent by the same proposer.

  
<h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.008.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Example of epochs in a semi-synchronous trajectory</figcaption>
</figure>
The diagram shows a semi-synchronous trajectory with three epochs with
times \(t^{0}\), \(t^{1}\), and \(t^{2}\), shown
in brown, blue and green, respectively. All the events and messages in epoch
\(t^{i}\) have timestamp \(t^{i}\). In epochs \(t^{0}\) and \(t^{2}\)
the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P1, while in
epoch \(t^{1}\) the only proposer that sends and receives messages is P0.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{0}\), proposer P1 increases its time (see step P.1) to  \(t^{0}\)
  and sends \(prepare(t^{0})\) messages --- shown as brown arrows ---
  to acceptors. The message to acceptor A0 is lost. An acceptor \(A\)
  that gets the message replies with \(promise(t^{0},
  A.accept\_v, A.accept\_t)\). Proposer P1 waits to receive at least 2
  \(promise\) messages because 2 is a majority for a set of 3
  agents. When it receives the 2 messages, P1 sends  \(accept(t^{0},
  P1.v)\) messages to acceptors. In this diagram, the \(accept\)
  messages sent to A0 and A1 are lost while A2 receives the
  message which, in turn, sends \(accepted\) messages. In this epoch, a
  majority of acceptors do not send \(accepted\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{1}\), proposer P0 increases its time to  \(t^{1}\)
  and sends \(prepare(t^{1})\) messages
  to acceptors. P0 timesout waiting to receive
  \(promise\) messages from a majority of acceptors, and so it
  sends no \(accept\) messages.

<p>
  In epoch \(t^{2}\), proposer P1 increases its time to  \(t^{2}\), and sends
  \(prepare(t^{2})\) messages. P1 receives
  \(promise\) messages from a majority of acceptors; sends
  proposals to acceptors; receives replies from a majority of
  acceptors, and then sends \(accept\) messages. The
  \(accept\) messages are received by a majority of acceptors, each
  of which sends \(accepted\) messages. So, learners that receive
  \(accepted\) messages from a majority of acceptors, set the values
  that they learned to the value in the \(accept\) messages.
  
  



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</h3>
If a majority of acceptors accept the same value, \(V^{*}\) in an
epoch \(T^{*}\) of a semi-synchronous 
trajectory, then in all subsequent epochs:
<ol>
  <li>
    the value in all proposal and accept messages is \(V^{*}\), and
  </li>
  <li>
  for all acceptors \(A\):
    \( (A.accept\_t < T^{*}) \vee (A.accept\_v =  V^{*}) \)
		      </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h4>
The proof is by induction on successive epochs in the sequence of
epochs that follows epoch \(T^{*}\). Let \(T^{i}\) be the time of the
\(i\)-th epoch after epoch \(T^{*}\), and let \(T^{0} = T^{*}\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case: epoch \(T^{*}\)</p>
<i>Part 1</i>: All proposals are sent by the
same proposer in an epoch, and all proposals have the same timestamp
and value. Therefore, the value in all proposal and accept messages in
epoch \(T^{*}\) is \(V^{*}\).

<p>
<i>Part 2</i>:  In epoch \(T^{*}\), \(A.accept\_t\) is changed only when 
\(A.accept\_v\) is set to \(V^{*}\), and so part 2 follows.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Induction step: epoch \(T^{i+1}\)</p>
Assume that the theorem holds for epochs \(T^{0}, T^{1}, \ldots,
T^{i}\), and prove that it holds for epoch \(T^{i+1}\).
The result is vacuously true if no proposals are sent in
   this epoch. Consider the case where proposals are sent.

   <p>
     Because  \(A.accept\_t\) is never decreased, it follows
     that in all epochs after epoch \(T^{*}\) there is a majority of
     acceptors for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). 
   <p>
     A proposer \(p\) sends a proposal only if it receives
     \(updated\_time\) messages from a majority of acceptors. Any two
     majorities have at least one element in common. So, there exists
     an acceptor \(A\) that sends an \(updated\_time\) message to
     \(p\) and for which \(A.accept\_t \geq T^{*}\). Because
     \(A.accept\_t\) is positive, \(A.accept\_v\) 
     is not null (see the invariants).

   <p>
     So, proposer \(p\) identifies the \(updated\_time\) message with
     the largest \(A.accept\_t\). This value is greater than or equal
     to \(T^{*}\), and so the corresponding \(A.accept\_v \) is
     \(V^{*}\), and therefore the  proposal's value is
     \(V^{*}\). So, the value of accept messages is also \(V^{*}\),
     and if \(A.accept\_v\) is changed then the new value is \(V^{*}\).


     <h5 style="color:red;">Example</h5>
     This example illustrates the idea underlying the proof. In the
     next diagram, proposer P0 sends a \(new\_time(T^{*})\)
     message which is received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond
     with updated time messages with timestamp \(T^{*}\). Proposer P0
     receives both messages, and sends proposals to all acceptors. In
     this case the proposals are received by A0 and A2 which then send
     accept messages. When A0 and A2 receive the proposals they set
     \(A.accept\_t, A.accept\_v = T^{*}, V^{*}\), and these values
     remain unchanged until the next proposal is received. 
<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.009.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:60%">
    <figcaption>Fig.7: Idea underlying the proof</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram below shows an epoch T1 that follows epoch T0. In this
epoch, proposer P1 sends \(new\_time(T^{1})\) messages which are
received by acceptors A0 and A1 which respond with updated time
messages with timestamp \(T^{1}\).
When P1 gets both messages it sends proposals to all acceptors.
Let's use the argument of the proof
to determine the value of proposals and the accept message sent by A1 in this
epoch. 


<figure>
    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.010.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:60%">
    <figcaption>Fig.8: What can be proved about the next accept message?</figcaption>
</figure>


When P1 gets both updated time messages it
identifies the message with the largest value of \(A.accept\_t\). The
message sent by A0 has timestamp \(T^{*}\) whereas the message sent by
A1 has an earlier timestamp. So, the updated time message with the
largest \(A.accept\_t\) is the message sent by A0. 

P1 sends proposals with a value of
\(A0.accept\_t\) which is \(V^{*}\). The green circles show how the
value \(V^{*}\) is sent from A0 to P1 to A1.

   <p>
     We see that proposals and accept
messages have value \(V^{*}\) in the next epoch as well.

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct for
  Semi-Synchronous Trajectories</h3>
The specification of the algorithm is repeated here for convenience.
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Learners learn only proposed values.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>A learner doesn't change the value that it learns.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>All learners learn the same value.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

   <p  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
   The value of
<code>v</code> in every message is either null or <code>P.VALUE</code>
for some proposer P, and so part 1 follows. Parts 2 and 3 follow from
the previous theorem: if a majority of acceptors send identical
 \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) messages in an epoch, then in all succeeding
epochs, the value \(v\) of every accept message remains \(V^{*}\).


<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Paxos is Correct for
  all Trajectories</h3>

We have shown that the Paxos algorithm is correct for semi-synchronous
trajectories. Now we show the correctness of the algorithm for all
trajectories.

Let \([past(T), future(T)]\) be a cut of a timeline where \(past(T)\)
is the set of events with time \(T\) or
less. Therefore \(future(T)\) is the set of events with time greater than \(T\).

<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Consistent cuts</h4>
The cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) is consistent.

<h5  class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
There is no message from an event in \(future(T)\)
to an event in \(past(T)\).

<p>
  If a proposer sends a message in the future, i.e., with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor processes the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\), and is also in the future.
      Likewise, if a proposer sends a message with a timestamp
  \(T' > T\) then the event in which an acceptor receives the message also
      has timestamp \(T'\).

    <img src="./PaxosProof/PaxosProof.018.jpeg" alt="Fig8" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption>Fig.8: Consistent Cuts of Paxos Trajectories</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram shows a cut \([past(T), future(T)]\) of a trajectory. The
green circles represent events in the past, and the yellow circles
represent events in the future. A little analysis shows that there are
no edges from the future to the past. (Indeed, you can show that there
are no edges from the past to the future, and so the graph can be
partitioned into independent subgraphs.)

<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Paxos is Correct</h3>
Consider any trajectory \(X\) in which a majority of acceptors accepts \((T^{*},
V^{*})\). Let \(Y\) be the semi-synchronous trajectory corresponding
to X.

From the theorem on semi-synchronous trajectories, for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(Y\) with \(T' \geq T\) have \(V' =
V^{*}\).
Because the global states are identical in \(X\) and \(Y\), for all
acceptances \((T', V')\) in \(X\) with \(T' \geq T\) also have \(V' =
V^{*}\). Therefore if a learner receives \(accept(T^{*}, V^{*})\) from a
majority of acceptors, and the same or another learner receives \(accept(T', V')\) from a
majority of acceptors, then \(V' = V^{*}\) and the correctness of parts 2 and 3 of the
specification follow.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Learners</h4>
The algorithm for learners is simple:
A learner determines that the consensus value is <code>V</code> if the
learner receives <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages from a majority of
acceptors with identical values of <code>(T, V)</code>.
We ignore learners in the algorithm description, and restrict
attention to whether and when a majority of
acceptors sends <code>accept(T, V)</code> messages with identical
values of <code>(T, V)</code>.
