    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Consensus: Oral Messages</h1>
    This module is a continuation of the previous module. This module
    describes solutions to the Byzantine problem with oral messages
    whereas the previous problem studied the problem with written
    messages.
    
    <p>
    Let \(t\) be an upper bound on the number of disloyal agents.
    We will
show later that there is no solution for the case where the number of loyal
agents is less than or equal to \(2.t\). We will
describe an algorithm in which there are at
least \(3.t + 1\) total agents.  The algorithm also solves the problem
where there are more than \(t\) disloyal agents provided that the
general is loyal. We illustrate the algorithm with examples and then
prove that the algorithm is correct.

<p>
Messages in the algorithm are either <i>attack</i> or <i>retreat</i>
messages. The absence of a message in a round is treated the same as
way as receiving a <i>retreat</i> message.

<p>
Let the general be
agent \(g\), and let \(L\) be the set of lieutenants. The general is
not a lieutenant: \(g \notin L\). The general sends a
message \(m(g,l)\) to each lieutenant \(l\). Then, the
lieutenants communicate among themselves so that each lieutenant
determines a consensus value.


<p>
A Byzantine problem is defined by
  \(g\), the index of the general;

  the set \(L\) of lieutenants; and

    \(t\) the upper bound on the number of disloyal agents.

    Let
    \(Byz(g,L,t)\) be the algorithm that solves problem \((g, L,
    t)\) and
let
\(c_{l}(g, L, t)\) be the consensus value computed by lieutenant
\(l\) for the problem. The specification is:


<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Validity</i>: Loyal lieutenants obey a loyal general.
  <p>
  If a general \(g\) is loyal then it broadcasts the same message to
  all lieutenants.
  So, for all lieutenants, \(j,
  k \): \(\; m(g,j) = m(g,k)\).
  In this case, the consensus value \(c_{l}\)
  of a loyal 
  lieutenant \(l\) is the message \(m(g,l)\) that the general sent to 
  \(l\). 
  <p>
  \(
  c_{l}(g, L, t) = m(g,l)
  \)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Consensus</i>: All loyal lieutenants \(j,k\) have the same
  consensus value.
  <p>
  \(
  c_{j}(g, L, t) = c_{k}(g, L, t)
  \)
</ol>
 
The algorithm is recursive. The algorithm for \(t = k > 0\) calls the
algorithm for \(t = k-1\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Base Case: \(Byz(g,L,t)\), when \(t = 0\)
</h4>
Algorithm: All agents obey the general.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">\(Byz(g,L,t)\) when \(t > 0\)</h3>
The algorithm has 3 steps.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Step 1. Initialize: General sends messages</h4>
The general, \(g\), sends a message to each 
lieutenant. Thereafter the general remains idle.

<p>
Let \(m(g, j)\) be the message that the general, \(g\), sends to
lieutenant \(j\). A
loyal general broadcasts the same message to all 
lieutenants, and so \(m(g, j) = m(g, k)\) for all lieutenants
\(j, k\).
A disloyal general may send different messages to different 
lieutenants.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Step 2. Recursion: Run 
\(Byz(j, L-j, t-1)\) for \(j \in L\) </h4> 

For each \(j \in L\), run the algorithm with agent \(j\) as the general and
the remaining set \(L-j\) of lieutenants continuing to play the role
of lieutenants, and at most \(t-1\) faulty agents.

<p>
Let \(m(g, j, k)\) be the message that agent \(j\) sends to
lieutenant \(k\) in the algorithm \(Byz(j, L-j, t-1)\). If agent \(j\) is
loyal then it broadcasts the message that it received from \(g\).
<p>
\(m(g, j, k) = m(g, j)\)
<p>
If \(j\) is disloyal then \(m(g, j, k)\) is arbitrary.

<p>
Think of \(m(g, j, k)\) in the following way. Agent \(j\) tells agent
\(k\) that agent \(j\) received message \(m(g, j, k)\) from agent
\(g\). A loyal \(j\) is truthful, and so \(m(g, j, k) = m(g, j)\). A
disloyal agent \(j\) may lie, and so \(m(g, j, k)\) may be different
from \(m(g, j)\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Step 3. Aggregate results of the
recursions</h4>
We will discussing step 3 after giving examples of steps 1 and 2.



<h2  style="color:red;">Example</h2>
Let's look at the messages in a problem with \(g = 0\),
\(L = \{1, \ldots, 6\}\), and \(t = 2\)
The general - agent \(0\) - sends messages \(m(0,j)\) to each lieutenant
\(j\). This is shown in the rooted tree in the diagram below 
with \(0\) as the root and the edges labeled with the messages that
are sent.

<p>
A loyal general broadcasts the same message to every lieutenant. If
agent \(0\) 
is loyal, let \(m(0)\) be the message that the general broadcasts.
So, if agent \(0\) is loyal then \(m(0,j) = m(0)\) for all \(j\).
If, however, agent \(0\) is disloyal then \(m(0,j)\) is arbitrary.

<figure>
    <img src="Slide08.jpg" alt="Fig8" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.6: Messages Sent</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let \(m(0,1,j)\) be the message that agent \(1\) sends to agent \(j\),
for \(j \in \{2 \ldots, 6\}\) for the problem in which \(g = 1\),
\(L=\{2 \ldots, 6\}\), 
and \(t=1\).
If agent \(1\) is loyal, then \(m(0,1,j) = m(0,1)\)

<p>
The diagram 
also shows the messages \(m(0,1,2,j)\) that agent \(2\) sends to agent \(j\),
in the algorithm when \(g=2\), \(L=\{3 \ldots, 6\}\), and \(t=0\).
If
agent \(2\) is loyal, then
\(m(0,1,2,j) = m(0,1,2)\), for all \(j\).

<h4  style="color:red;">Example: Agents 5, 6 are disloyal</h2>
Let \(m(0)\)  be the message that the loyal general -- agent \(0\) --
broadcasts.Then:
<ol>
  <li>
\(m(0,i) = m(0)\)
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,j) = m(0)\) for loyal \(i\), i.e., for
  \(1 \leq i \leq 4\)
  </li>
  
  <li>
\(m(0,i,j) \;\) is arbitrary for disloyal \(i\), i.e. \(i = 5, 6\)
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,j,k) = m(0)\) for loyal \(i, j\), i.e. for \(1
  \leq i,j \leq 4\). 
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,j,k) \;\) is arbitrary for for disloyal \(i\) or \(j\), i.e. \(5
  \leq i \leq 6\) or \(5 \leq j \leq 6\)
  </li>
</ol>
Note: These messages are defined only when the subscripts, \(0, i, j,
k\) are distinct. 


<h4  style="color:red;">Example: Agents 0, 1 are disloyal</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
\(m(0,i) = \;\)  is arbitrary.
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,j) = m(0,i)\) for loyal \(i\), i.e., for
  \(2 \leq i \leq 6\)
  </li>
  <li>
\(m(0,1,j) = \;\)  is arbitrary.
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,j,k) = m(0,i,j) \) for loyal \(j\), i.e. for \(2
  \leq j \leq 6\). 
  </li>
  <li>
  \(m(0,i,1,k) \;\) is arbitrary because agent \(1\) is disloyal.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>



<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Step 3. Aggregate results of recursive calls</h2>

<p>
Each node of the tree in the diagram represents messages sent in a Byanztine generals
problem. Let 
\(P(0,i_{1}, i_{2}, \ldots, i_{r})\) be the problem in
which agent \(i_{r}\) sends messages \(m(0,i_{1}, i_{2}, \ldots,
i_{r},j)\) to agents \(j\).

<h5  style="color:red;">Example</h5>
In the diagram with \(N=7\) agents in total, with at most \(t=2\) of the 7 being
faulty, there is:
<ol>
  <li>
  A single problem \(P(0)\). For this problem \(t=2\). In this
  problem, agent \(0\) sends message \(m(0,i)\) to agent \(i\) for
  \(i = 1, \ldots 6\).
  </li>
  <li>
  \(N-1 = 6\) problems \(P(0,i)\). For these problems \(t=1\). In
  problem \(P(0,i)\), agent \(i\) sends message  \(m(0,i,j)\) to
  agent \(j\), where \(j\) is different from \(0\) and \(i\).
  </li>
  <li>
  \((N-1) \times (N-2) = 30\) problems \(P(0,i,j)\). For these problems \(t=0\). In
  problem \(P(0,i,j)\), agent \(j\) sends message  \(m(0,i,j,k)\) to
  agent \(k\), where \(k\) is different from \(0\), \(i\) and \(j\).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Aggregating results</h3>
Let 
\(c_{l}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r})\)
be the consensus value
reached by a loyal agent \(l\) for the problem \(P(0, i_{1}, \ldots,
i_{r})\) where
\(l\) is different from \(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}\).
We will show that the \(c_{l}\) satisfy the specification:
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Validity</i>:
  If agent \(i_{r}\) is loyal then this value is the message that
\(i_{r}\) sent to \(l\),
  <p>
  \(c_{l}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}) = m(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}, l) \)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Consensus</i>:
  All loyal agents determine the same
  consensus value even if \(i_{r}\) is disloyal.
  <p>
  For loyal \(j,k\):
  <br>
  \(c_{j}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}) = c_{k}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r})
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Base Case \(t = 0\):</h4>
<p>
\(
c_{l}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}) = m(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r},l)
\)
<p>
i.e., the consensus value computed by loyal agent \(l\) is the message
that \(l\) received from agent \(i_{r}\) in this problem.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">For the case \(t > 0\):</h4>
<p>
\(
c_{l}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}) = \textrm{majority of}
\)
<br>
\(
\quad ( \; c_{l}(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r},j) \; \textrm{all} \; j \notin
\{0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}, l\},
\)
<br>
\(
\quad \; \; m(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r},l) \; )
\)

<p>
The majority is taken over the message \(m(0, i_{1}, \ldots,
i_{r},l)\) that agent \(l\) received from agent \(i_{r}\) and the
consensus values \(c_{l}(P(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r},j))\) that agent
\(l\) computes for problem \(P(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r},j)\).

<h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Let's compute consensus values for the case of 7 agents indexed \(0,
\ldots, 6\), where agents \(0, \ldots, 4\) are loyal and agents \(5,
6\) are disloyal. Let \(m(0)\) be the message that agent \(0\)
broadcasts. Then for all loyal \(i, j, k\):
<p>
\(
m(0) = m(0,i) = m(0,i,j) = m(0,i,j, k)
\)

<p style="color:red;">Let's compute \(c_{3}(0,1,2)\)</p>
\(c_{3}(0,1,2)\)  is the consensus value that agent \(3\) computes for
the problem in which 
agent \(2\) sends message \(m(0,1,2,j)\) to agent \(j\) for \(j = 3,
4, 5, 6\). This corresponds to the problem at the top right in the
diagram. 

<p>
\(t = 0\) for this problem. So
\(c_{3}(0,1,2) = m(0,1,2,3)\).
<p>
By the same argument, for loyal 
\(i, j, k\):
<p>
\(c_{k}(0,i,j) = m(0, i, j, k)\)
<p>
Because \(m(0, i, j, k) = m(0, i, j)\), for all loyal \(k\):
<p>
\(
c_{k}(0,i,j) = m(0, i, j)
\)
<p>
and so the
\(c_{k}(0,i,j)\) satisfies the validity and consensus requirements of
the specification for problem \(P(0,i,j)\).

<p style="color:red;">Let's compute \(c_{2}(0,1)\).</p>
<p>
Because \(t > 0\):
<p>
\(
c_{2}(0,1) = 
\)
<br>
\(
\; \textrm{majority}(
c_{2}(0,1,3), c_{2}(0,1,4), c_{2}(0,1,5),
c_{2}(0,1,6), m(0,1,2)) \; = 
\) 
<br>
\(
\textrm{majority}(
m(0,1,3), m(0,1,4), c_{2}(0,1,5),
c_{2}(0,1,6),  m(0,1,2)) \; = 
\) 
<br>
\(
\textrm{majority}(m(0,1), m(0,1), c_{2}(0,1,5),
c_{2}(0,1,6),  m(0,1)) \; = 
\) 
<br>
\(
\quad m(0,1)
\)
<p>
By similar arguments, for all loyal \(i, j\):
<p>
\(
c_{j}(0, i) = m(0,i)
\) and 
\(
c_{i}(0) = m(0)
\)

<p style="color:red;">Does the solution satisfy the specification for
all problems \(P(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r})\)</p>
To satisfy consensus for problem \(P(0, 1, 5)\), we must have \(c_{2}(0,
1, 5) = c_{3}(0, 1, 5)\); but that may false because \(m(0, 1, 5, 2)\) may be
different from \(m(0, 1, 5, 3)\) because agent \(5\) is disloyal.

<p>
So, <i>the algorithm does not satisfy the specification for all problems
\(P(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r})\)</i>. It does, however, satisfy the
specification for problems in which the number of loyal agents exceeds
twice the number of disloyal ones.

<p>
The problem \(P(0, 1, 5)\) has 2 disloyal agents (5 and 6) -- and 3
loyal agents (2, 3, 4); and so this problem does not satisfy the
criterion that the number of loyal agents exceeds twice the number of
disloyal ones.

<h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Let's look at an example in which agents \(0\), \(1\) are disloyal and
agents \(2, \ldots, 6\) are loyal. From the arguments in the previous
example, for loyal \(j,k\), i.e., for \(j, k \in 2, \ldots, 6\):
<p>
\(c_{k}(0, 1, j) = m(0, 1, j)
\)

<p>
Next let's compute \(c_{2}(0, 1)\).

<p>
\(
c_{2}(0, 1) = \textrm{majority} \;
c_{2}(0, 1, 3), \ldots, c_{2}(0, 1, 6), m(0, 1, 2)
\)

<p>
\(
c_{2}(0, 1) = \textrm{majority} \;
m(0, 1, 3), \ldots, m(0, 1, 6), m(0, 1, 2)
\)

<p>
By the same argument, for all loyal \(j\): 
\(
c_{j}(0, 1) = \textrm{majority} \;
m(0, 1, 2), \ldots, m(0, 1, 6)
\)

<p>
So, the \(c_{j}(0, 1)\) all \(j\) satisfy the specification for
problem \(P(0,1)\). By the same argument we can show that 
\(c_{i}(0)\) all \(i\) satisfy the specification for
problem \(P(0)\).


<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h2>
We set \(i_{0} = 0\) and 
first prove that the algorithm is correct for problem
\(P(i_{0}, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r})\) when agent \(i_{r}\) is loyal, and
later consider the case when \(i_{r}\) is disloyal. We will show that
when \(i_{r}\) is loyal, the consensus computed by all loyal agents
\(l\) is the message \(m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r})\) that 
that \(i_{r}\) broadcast.
<p>
\(
c_{l}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r}) = m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r})
\)

<p>
The proof is by induction.
Base case: We prove the
algorithm for problems at the leaves of the tree, i.e. for problems:
\(P(0, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{t})\).
For the induction step, we assume that the algorithm is correct
for problems at depth \(k\) in the tree, and then prove that the
algorithm is correct for problems at depth \(k-1\), i.e.,
we assume that the solution is correct for all
problems \(P(i_{0}\), for \(i_{k}\) and prove that the 
algorithm is correct for problems \(P(i_{0}, i_{1}, \ldots,
i_{k-1})\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal"> Base case: Leaf of the Tree:
Problems \(P(i_{0}, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{t})\)</h4> 
There are at least \(2.t  + 1\) loyal agents in the system. So,
there are at least \(t\)
loyal lieutenants and at most \(t\)
disloyal lieutenants
in problem \(P(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t})\).

<p>
\(c_{j}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t})\) is the majority of messages \(m
(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t}, k, j)\) for all \(k\) not in \(i_{0},
\ldots, i_{t}, j\), and the message \(m(i_{0}, \ldots,
i_{t}, j)\).

<p>
Because \(i_{t}\) is loyal, \(m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t}, j) = m(i_{0},
\ldots, i_{t})\) for all loyal \(j\). Therefore the majority is taken
over at least \(t+1\) messages with value \(m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t})\).
These \(t+1\) or more messages form a majority regardless of the
values of the \(t\) disloyal agents. So, for loyal \(i_{t}, j\):
<p>
\(
c_{j}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t}) = m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t})
\)

<h4 class="w3-text-teal"> Induction Step</h4>
<p>
\(c_{j}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k})\) is the majority of messages \(c_{j}
(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k}, l)\) for all \(l\) not in \(i_{0},
\ldots, i_{k}, j\), and the message \(m(i_{0}, \ldots,
i_{k}, j\).
<p>
From the assumption of the induction step, for loyal \(j\):
<p>
\(
c_{j}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k}, l) =
m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k}, l)
\)
<p>
Because \(i_{k}\) is loyal: 
\(
m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k}, l) =
m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k})
\)
<p>
Therefore the majority is taken over at least \(t+1\) loyal agents
\(j\) each of which computes the common consensus value of
\(m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k})\), and these values out-votes values of disloyal
agents. Therefore, for loyal \(i_{k}, j\):
<p>
\(
c_{j}(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k}) = m(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{k})
\)

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Disloyal general</h4>
We will prove that all loyal lieutenants come to the same consensus
when the general is disloyal.

<p>
In every problem \(P(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{t})\), at least one of the
agents \(i_{k}\) is loyal because there are at most \(t\) disloyal agents.
Let's consider the truncated
tree in which leaves represent problems \(P(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r})\) where
agents \(i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r-1}\) are disloyal and agent \(i_{r}\) is
loyal.

<p>
We showed that the algorithm is correct for problem \(P(i_{0}, \ldots,
i_{r})\) if agent \(i_{r}\) is loyal.
Therefore the algorithm is correct for every leaf of the truncated
tree. We will now prove by induction on the depth of the truncated
tree that the algorithm is correct for all nodes at all depths, i.e.,
consensus holds: For all loyal agents \(k, l\): 
<p>
\(
c_{k}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}) = c_{l}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r})
\)
<p>
From the algorithm, the terms on both sides of the above equation are
majorities of the following sets:
<p>
\(
\{c_{k}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, j), \; j \notin \{i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r}, k\},
m(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, k)\}
\)
<br>
\(
\{c_{l}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, j), \; j \notin \{i_{0}, \ldots, i_{r}, l\},
m(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, l)\}
\)
<p>
The two sets are identical because:
<p>

\(
c_{k}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, j) = c_{l}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, j)
\), for \(j \notin \{k, l\}\). Follows from the induction hypothesis.
<p>
\(
c_{k}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, l) = m(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, l)
\) and
\(
c_{l}(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, k) = m(i_{0}, \ldots i_{r}, k)
\)
because agents \(k, l\) are loyal.
