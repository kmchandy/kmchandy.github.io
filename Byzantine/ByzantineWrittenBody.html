Messages</h1>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module introduces Byzantine consensus algorithms in which agents
reach consensus in a sequence of synchronized rounds <i>even though some
agents don't follow the protocol</i>.
</h4>


    In this module we study algorithms by which a collection of agents
    reach a consensus among alternative values.
    <a href="../Paxos/Paxos.html">The Paxos algorithm</a> is
    an example of how agents reach consensus.
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">
    Agents cannot reach consensus if message delays or agent
    operations are arbitrarily slow.</a> Next, we study a consensus
    algorithm in which message delays are bounded and in which agents
    are guaranteed to come to a consensus <i>even though some agents
    do not follow the protocol.</i>

    <p>
    The
    algorithm operates in a sequence of steps called <i>rounds</i>.
    All messages sent in a round are delivered in the same round, and
    all agents execute actions in each round after receiving
    messages sent in that round. So, the Byzantine algorithm that we
    describe next is synchronous.

    <p>
    The Byzantine generals problem is an important problem with
    applications in various domains including that of maintaining a
    distributed ledger.
    

    We describe the problem by means of an apocryphal story of the
    fall of the Byzantine empire which is attributed, in part, to
    disloyal leaders. The choice of the name "Byzantine Generals"
    for a problem in computer science is
    curious and interesting, but not relevant to the algorithm.

    <p>
    A general has \(N\) army units each of which
    is led by a lieutenant general, herafter referred to merely as
    lieutenant. We refer to the general and the lieutenants,
    collectively, as agents. An agent may be either loyal or
    disloyal. 

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Generals Problem: Specification</h4>
    The general gives a command which is either
    attack or retreat.
    <ol>
      <li><i>Validity</i>: Loyal lieutenants must obey a loyal general. If a loyal general
    gives the command to attack then all loyal lieutenants must
    attack. Likewise, if a loyal general
    gives the command to retreat then all loyal lieutenants must
    retreat.</li>
      <li><i>Consensus</i>: Loyal lieutenants come to a consensus: either all of them
    attack or all of them retreat.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  If the general is loyal then consensus follows because all
  lieutenants obey the general. The challenge is to ensure consensus
  when the general is disloyal.

  <p>
  
    The specification does not require that traitors be
    discovered. For example, the algorithm doesn't have to determine
    whether the general or a lieutenant is loyal or disloyal. 

    <p>
    The algorithm proceeds as follows. A loyal general gives the same
    command to all lieutenants. A disloyal general may give
    different commands to different lieutenants and may give no
    commands to some. Then the lieutenants communicate among
    themselves and reach a consensus after a specified number of
    rounds.

    <p>
    The figure below illustrates the difference between loyal and
    disloyal generals.

    <figure>
    <img src="Slide01.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Loyal and disloyal general behavior</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
    A loyal lieutenant sends the same message to all
    lieutenants in a round. A traitor may send different messages to
    different lieutenants and may send no messages to some.
    A lieutenant who receives a message knows which lieutenant sent
    it.

    <p>
    If the only requirement is validity, and consensus isn't
    required, then the solution is trivial: all loyal lieutenants obey
    the general whether the general is loyal or disloyal. If the only
    requirement is consensus, and validity isn't required, then the
    solution is trivial: all loyal lieutenants agree on a predefined
    value, say retreat, regardless of the command issued by the
    general. The conjunction of both requirements, validity and
    consensus, makes the problem interesting.

    
    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Oral and Written Messages</h3>
  We begin by looking at two versions of the problem.

  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Written Messages</h4>
  In this
    version a lieutenant may send copies of messages to other
lieutenants but cannot modify the copies. Also, a lieutenant
cannot forge signatures. 
<p>
For example, suppose lieutenant \(A\) sends lieutenant \(B\) a message
  \(M\). All messages are signed and encrypted; so message \(M\) is
  signed by \(A\). Lieutenant \(B\) can forward the message to
  lieutenant \(C\); however, \(B\) cannot modify the message or forge
  the signature on it. So, when \(C\) gets message \(M\), \(C\) knows
that \(A\) sent exactly that message.


    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Oral Messages</h4>
    In this version of the problem, messages can be modified and signatures can be
forged.
<p>
Consider the same example as in the previous paragraph.
Suppose lieutenant \(A\) sends lieutenant \(B\) a message
\(M\). Lieutenant \(B\) can send a message \(M'\) to lieutenant \(C\)
    and forge \(A\)'s signature on the message. So, when \(C\)
    receives the message \(C\) doesn't know whether \(M'\) was sent by  
\(A\) or modified by agents that forwarded the message.
    <p>
    In the literature, the two versions are referred to as the 
    with <i>written</i> and <i>oral message</i> versions, respectively. This is
    because when lieutenants speak to each other, a lieutenant \(X\)
    can tell a lieutenant \(B\) that 
    another lieutenant \(C\)  told \(B\) that \(C\) is going to attack when
    \(C\) said no such thing. When they send written messages, the
    receiver of a message can detect modified messages and forged
    signatures. We will also refer to the written version as the 
<i>encrypted</i> version, and the oral version as 
<i>unencrypted</i>.
<p>
In summary: Byzantine consensus with written messages assumes that messages are
encrypted and encrypted messages can be copied but not modified, and
signatures cannot be forged. Byzantine consensus with oral messages
deals with the case where messages can be modified and forged. The
algorithm with encrypted messages is simpler.


    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm with Written Messages</h2>
    Next, let's look at an algorithm for the case where messages
cannot be modified and signatures cannot be forged. 

<p>
Let the number of disloyal agents be \(t\). The problem is trivial if
there are no loyal agents. Likewise the solution is obvious if
there is only one loyal agent because the requirement of consensus is
vaccuous; there is no other loyal agent with which to reach consensus.
So we now assume \(N \geq t + 2\).

<p>
We give the algorithm for loyal agents. Disloyal agents may take any
action and send any message in each round.

<p>
The algorithm proceeds in a sequence of synchronous rounds. We
describe the algorithm in two parts: in the first part the algorithm
does not terminate; we discuss termination in the second part. Next we
describe the first part.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Initiation of round \(0\) </p>
The general starts round 0 by sending a message to each lieutenant. A
message is either attack or retreat.

<p>
A faulty general may not
send a message to a lieutenant.
A lieutenant that doesn't receive a message from the general treats
the absence of the message as though the general had sent a default
message. Let's assume that the default is retreat.
So, a lieutenant that does not get a message in round 0 acts as though
it received a retreat message on this round.
<p>
At the start of round 0 no lieutenant has committed
to attack or retreat.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Round \(j\) where \(j \geq 0\)</p>
(We discuss termination later; for the time being assume that rounds
go on forever.)
<p>
During round \(j\),
if a lieutenant \(B\) who has not committed to attack on previous
rounds receives an
attack message signed by the general and at least \(j\) attack messages signed
by \(j\) distinct lieutenants other than \(B\) , then at the end of
round \(j\):
<ol>
  <li>
  If \(B\) commits to attack at the end of round \(j\) then
  \(B\) remains committed to attack on all subsequent rounds.
  <p>
  Note that the attack and retreat commands are not treated in a symmetric
  fashion.
  If \(B\) does not commit to attack at the end of round \(j\) it may
  commit to attack in a later round.
  </li>
  <li>
  If lieutenant \(B\) commits to attack for the first time on round
  \(j\) then \(B\) broadcasts the evidence that it received which
  caused it to commit. This evidence consists of a copy of the attack
  message signed by the general and copies of
  the attack messages signed by \(j\) distinct lieutenants.
  In addition \(B\) broadcasts a copy of an attack message
  signed by \(B\) itself. Thus \(B\) broadcasts an attack message
  signed by the general and \(j+1\) attack messages signed by \(j+1\) distinct
  lieutenants. These messages are received by all lieutenants at the start of the next
  (i.e. \(j+1\)-th) round.
  <p>
  If lieutenant \(B\) does not commit to attack on round \(j\) then it
  sends no messages on this round.
  </li>
</ol>




<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: loyal lieutenants obey a loyal
general.</h4> 

<p>
If the general broadcasts attack
messages on round 0 then all loyal lieutenants commit to attack at the
end of round 0.
If the general never sends attack messages then lieutenants never
receive copies of attack messages signed by the general; so,
loyal lieutenants never commit to attack.
Therefore, when the general is loyal, consensus among loyal
lieutenants is reached by the end of round 0.


<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: if any loyal lieutenant commits to
  attack for the first time on round \(j\) then all loyal lieutenants commit to
attack by the end of round \(j +  1\).</h4>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
A loyal lieutenant commits to attack  attack for the first time on
round \(j\) if it receives an attack message from the general and
attack messages from at least \(j\) lieutenants.

<p>
(These messages may
have been forwarded by other lieutenants. Moreover, some of these
attack messages may have been generated by disloyal lieutenants.)

<p>
When the loyal lieutenant commits to attack it sends copies of the evidence it
received and a message commmiting itself to attack. So, on round
\(j+1\) all loyal
lieutenants receive an attack message from the general and \(j+1\)
attack messages from different lieutenants; and so they commit to
attack on round \(j+1\) if they haven't done so.

<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>

The figure below illustrates a situation in which a loyal lieutenant C commits to
attack on round 2, if it hasn't already committed to attack by then.
The figure shows C
getting attack messages (red boxes) signed by the general and lieutenants A and B on
round 2. The general and lieutenants A and B may be disloyal or
loyal.

    <figure>
    <img src="Slide02.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example of a lieutenant committing to attack</figcaption>
</figure>

 

<p>
 Because C is loyal it follows the algorithm, and C
commits to attack at the end of round 2 because C receives a signed attack
 message from the general and signed attack messages from two
 different lieutenants.
So, at the end of round 2, C broadcasts attack messages
signed by the general and (copies of) attack
messages signed by A and B and attack messages signed by C. All loyal
lieutenants commit to attack by the end round 3 because they receive
messages signed by the general and 3 different lieutenants (A, B, C).

<p>
The algorithm works because messages cannot be forged. Loyal
lieutenant C doesn't know whether the general and lieutenants A and B
are loyal. But C has proof that they send attack messages to C because
C got signed messages from them, and these messages couldn't have come
from anybody else. And C passes on that proof to other lieutenants
by copying and forwarding the messages that it received.

<p>
A loyal
lieutenant D receives messages from the general and A, B, and C on
round 3. Again, lieutenant D doesn't know whether the senders of the
messages that it received are loyal; but, it doesn't matter because D
has proof that they sent those messages. So, D commits to attack on
round 3.

<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: if no loyal lieutenant commits to
  attack by the start of round \(t\) then all loyal lieutenants never commit to
attack.</h4>
Consider the case where the general is disloyal because we have
already dealt with the case of a loyal general.

<p>
Since the general is disloyal and the system has a maximum of \(t\)
disloyal officers, there are at most \(t-1\) disloyal lieutenants. On
round \(t\) these disloyal lieutenants can send attack messages from
at most \(t-1\) lieutenants. But, a loyal lieutenant commits to
attack for the first time on round \(t\), only if it receives at least
\(t\) messages. So, no loyal lieutenant commits to attack on round
\(t\).


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Consider a system with a general and four lieutenants, A, B, C,
D. Assume that the general and lieutenant D are disloyal. If none of
A, B, C have committed to attack at the start of round 2, then none of
them will commit to attack during round 2. This is because D can send
signed attack messages from the general and from D, but that's not
enough evidence on round 2 to cause loyal lieutenants to commit to
attack. 

<h4  class="w3-text-teal">Termination</h4>
The algorithm terminates at the end of round \(t\) because subsequent
rounds don't change the outcome of all loyal
lieutenants.

<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  Assume that you are explaining the algorithm to someone who hasn't
  taken a course on distributed computing. How would you explain to
  this person that even if the general and 999 lieutenants are
  disloyal, and only 2 lieutenants are loyal, the loyal lieutenants
  reach a consensus after round 100? 
  (Remember the first round is round 0.)
  <li>
  Will the algorithm work if at most one lieutenant could modify
  written messages, and all the other lieutenants followed the
  protocol, i.e. these lieutenants could copy but not modify
  messages. 
  </li>
</ol>
