<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Consensus: Oral Messages</h1>

<p class="w3-text-teal">

This module describes a Byzantine consensus algorithm in which
messages are not encrypted. An agent <i>x</i> that receives a message signed by
an agent <i>y</i> cannot tell whether <i>y</i> signed the message or
whether some other agent forged <i>y</i>'s signature and corrupted the message.
</p>

<p>
This module describes solutions to the Byzantine problem with oral
messages whereas the previous module studied the problem with written
messages.  For convenience we repeat the problem specification next.

<p>
A general has \(N\) army units each of which is led by a lieutenant
who may be either loyal or disloyal.
The general may, likewise, be loyal or disloyal.
The general sends a command to
each lieutenant where the command is either attack or retreat.
A loyal general sends the same message to all lieutenants whereas a
disloyal general may send different messages to different lieutenants.
Each
lieutenant decides to attack or retreat at the end of the
algorithm.
If the general is loyal then the decision made by each loyal
lieutenant is the message that the general sent to that
lieutenant. Even if the general is disloyal, all loyal lieutenants
must make the same the decision.

<p>
Let \(m[i]\) be the message that the general sends
lieutenant \(i\), and let \(a[i]\) be the decision the lieutenant
\(i\) makes. Let \(m*\) be the message that a loyal general sends to
all lieutenants; so if the general is loyal \(m[i] = m*\) for all
\(i\).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Specification</h4>
The specification has two parts:
    <ol>
      <li>
      <i>Validity</i>: Loyal lieutenants must obey a loyal
      general.
      <p>
      \(
      (\forall i: m[i] = m*) \; \Rightarrow \;
      (\forall \; \textrm{loyal lieutenants} \; j: a[j] = m*)
      \)
      
      </li>
      <li><i>Consensus</i>: Loyal lieutenants must make the same
      decision.
      <p>
      \(
      (\forall \; \textrm{loyal lieutenants} \; j, k: a[j] = a[k])
      \)
      
      </li>
  </ol>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Assumptions</h4>
The oral Byzantine version makes fewer assumptions than the written
  version. The assumptions made are as follows: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Synchrony:</i> The algorithm operates in a synchronous fashion in a sequence of
  rounds or synchronous steps. If an agent \(x\) does not send
  a message to an agent \(y\) in a given round then \(y\) can detect
  that \(x\) did not send a message to it in that round.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Reliability:</i> If an agent \(y\) sends a message \(m\) to an agent \(y\) in a given
  round then \(z\) receives \(m\) in that round.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Receiver knows sender:</i> An agent that receives a message knows which agent sent it. If an
  agent \(z\) receives a message \(m\) from an agent \(y\) in a round
  then \(z\) knows that \(y\) sent \(m\) in that round.
  </li>
</ol>


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Why oral messages are harder</h4>

In the written version of the problem, if an agent
\(z\) receives a message \(m\) from any agent where \(m\) is signed by the
general then \(z\) knows that the general did send \(m\).
An agent cannot forge the general's signature and send a false
message.
By contrast, in the oral, or unencrypted version, any agent can
forge any agent's signature and send corrupted messages.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Bounds</h4>
Throughout this module \(t\) is an upper bound on the number of
disloyal agents.  We will show later that there is no solution when
the the number of loyal agents is less than or equal to \(2t\). Next
we describe an algorithm in which there are more than \(2t\)
non-faulty agents. So the total number of agents is at least \(3t +
1\) agents.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm</h2>

Messages in the algorithm are either <i>attack</i> or <i>retreat</i>
messages.  If an agent \(x\) does not receive a message from an agent
\(y\) on a round then \(x\) treats the absence of the message from
\(y\) in the same way as if \(x\) received a <i>retreat</i> message
from \(y\). So, the algorithm only deals with <i>attack</i> and
<i>retreat</i> messages and does not deal with steps that an agent
takes if it does not receive a message.

<p>
First, we define an algorithm \(B(k)\) recursively
for nonnegative integers \(k\). The agents in this algorithm are a
single general and one or more lieutenants. We describe the algorithm
for an arbitrary number of lieutenants, some of which may be disloyal.
Later, we will show how algorithm \(B\) is
used to solve the Byzantine problem where there are at least \(3t +
1\) agents, of which at most \(t\) are disloyal.

<p>
The structure of algorithm \(B(k)\), for all \(k\), is as follows.
<p>
The general sends command \(m[i]\) to lieutenant \(i\), for each
lieutenant. If the general is loyal, then the general sends the same
message, \(m*\), to all agents, and therefore \(m[i] = m*\) for all
\(i\).  If the general is disloyal then the messages, \(m[i]\), are
arbitrary.

<p>
Each lieutenant \(i\) computes a value \(a[i]\). A loyal lieutenant \(i\)
follows the specified algorithm to determine \(a[i]\). A disloyal
lieutenant \(i\) sets \(a[i]\) to an arbitrary value. Next we describe
the algorithm followed by loyal agents.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case. \(B(0)\)</p>
The general sends message \(m[i]\) to lieutenant \(i\), for each \(i\).
Loyal lieutenant \(i\) sets \(a[i] = m[i]\)

<p class="w3-text-teal">Inductive Step: \(B(k), k > 0\)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Step 0: The general sends message \(m[i]\) to lieutenant \(i\), for
  each \(i\). 
  <p>
  The general plays no further part in the algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
  Step 1 - Messaging: Each lieutenant \(i\) acts as a general for
  algorithm \(B(k-1)\) executed on a new problem.
  The lieutenants in this new problem are the
  lieutenants in the original problem other than
  \(i\) itself. In the new problem,
  lieutenant \(i\), acting as a general, sends command \(m[i,j]\) to
  lieutenant \(j\). 
  <p>
  If lieutenant \(i\) is loyal then \(m[i, j] = m[i]\).
  <p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Step 2 - Aggregation:
  Let \(a[i, j]\) be the value that agent \(j\) computes
  using algorithm \(B(k-1)\) for the new
  problem in which lieutenant \(i\) acts as the general
  and \(j\) is a lieutenant. 
  <p>
  A loyal agent \(i\) sets \(a[i]\), in the original problem
  to be the
  majority value of a set \(S\) defined as follows.
  <p> \(S\) consists of \(m[i]\) and
  \(a[j, i]\), for all lieutenants \(j\) in the new problem in which
  \(i\) acts as the general.
  <p>
  \(
  S = \{m[i]\} \bigcup \{a[j,i] | j \neq i\}
  \)
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Diagrams Illustrating the Algorithm</p>
The algorithm operates in a sequence of steps with step \(k\)
providing input and getting output from step \(k -1\), for \(k > 0\).
Th algorithm stops at step \(t\).

The diagram below illustrates the algorithm. The problem has a
general, \(0\), and \(n\) lieutenants indexed \(1, \ldots, n\).
In the diagram,  the red dotted box represents step \(k\) in which
there are \(n\) executions of \(B(k)\), one call to \(B(k)\) for each
lieutenant.

<p>
The general  sends message \(m[i]\) to lieutenant \(i\).
The decision made by lieutenant \(i\) in step \(k\) is \(a[i]\).
Step \(k\) has input \(m[1, \ldots, n]\) and output \(a[1,
\ldots, n]\). 
<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.001.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:120%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: A Data Flow Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Inductive Step:</p>
Step \(k\) step generates inputs for, and gets outputs from, step
\(k-1\) for \(k > 0\).
The diagram below shows the flow of data between steps \(k\) and \(k-1\).
<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.002.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:120%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: A Data Flow Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

The general sends message \(m[i]\) to each lieutenant \(i\). The
messages are shown as edges directed to the vertex labeled \(m[i]\),
which are inputs to step \(k\).

<p>
Each lieutenant \(i\) executes \(B(k)\), and as part of executing \(B(k)\)
lieutenant \(i\) sends message \(m[i, j]\) to lieutenant \(j\) for all
\(j \neq i\). A loyal lieutenant broadcasts the message that it
receives.
<p>
For all loyal lieutenants \(i\) and all lieutenants \(j\):
<br>
\(m[i, j] = m[i]\)
<p>
The
message sent by lieutenant \(1\) to lieutenant \(2\) is shown as an
edge from vertex \(m[1]\) to vertex \(m[1,2]\). All the edges aren't
shown in the diagram so as not to crowd the picture.

<p>
There are \(n\)
inputs, \(m[1, \ldots, n]\) to step \(k\), and \(n \times (n-1)\)
inputs to step \(k-1\). Likewise, there are \(n\)
calls to \(B(k)\) in step \(k\), and \(n \times (n-1)\)
calls to \(B(k-1)\) in step \(k-1\).

<p>
The outputs of step \(k-1\) are \(a[i,j]\) for lieutenants \(i, j\)
where \(i \neq j\). The decision made by lieutenant \(j\) in the
Byzantine problem in which lieutenant \(i\) acts as the general and
\(j\) acts as a lieutenant. The outputs of step \(k\) are computed from the
outputs of step \(k-1\) as follows.
<p>
\(
a[i] = \textrm{majority}(\{m[i]\} \bigcup \{a[j, i] | j \neq i\})
\)
<p>
For example:
<p>
\(
a[1] = \textrm{majority}(m[1], a[2, 1], a[3, 1], \ldots, a[n, 1])
\)
<br>
\(
a[2] = \textrm{majority}(m[2], a[1, 2], a[3, 2], \ldots, a[n, 2])
\)
<p>
The variables \(m[i]\), \(a[i]\), and \(a[j, i]\)
are local to lieutant \(i\). So the calculation of \(a[i]\) does not
require communication.


<p>
We partition the algorithm into two phases: a  <i>messaging</i> phase
in which lieutenants send messages to each other, and an
<i>aggregating</i> phase in which each lieutenant carries out
computations on its own local data without communicating with other
lieutenants. In the diagram, the red edges represent messages
in the messaging phase, and blue edges represent dataflow in the
aggregating phase.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Step 0</p>
In step 0, the decision made by each lieutenant is in the message that
it receives.
<p>
\(
\forall i: \; a[i] = m[i]
\)
The next diagram illustrates step 0.
<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.003.jpeg" alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.3: Step 0</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 style="color:red;">Examples</h3>

The next diagram shows the messaging and aggregation phases with a
general and 3 lieutenants, and steps 1 and 0.

<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.004.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.4: Steps 1 and 0</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 style="color:red;">Example: 4 officers, loyal general.</h4>
The next diagram shows a situation in which the general and
lieutenants 1 and 2 are loyal and lieutenant 3 is disloyal. The
messages sent by the general are shown as green edges. Let \(m^{*}\)
be the message broadcast by the general.
<p>
Lieutenants 1
and 2 transmit the message they receive from the general, and so the
edges from \(m[1]\) and \(m[2]\) are also shown as green
edges.
<p>
\(m[1, 2] = m[1] = m^{*}\)
<p>
\(m[2, 1] = m[2] = m^{*}\)

<p>
Lieutenant 3 may send any message; so the edges from \(m[3]\)
are colored red representing \(?\) or unknown.
<p>
\(m[3, 1] = ? \) and \(m[3, 2] = ? \)

<p>
The decisions \(a[1]\) and \(a[2]\), made by lieutenants 1 and 2, are
computed as the majority of values in 2 green edges and 1 unknown
value along the red edge --- and that is the value on green edges.

<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.005.jpeg" alt="Fig5" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Example with loyal general</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let's use algebra rather than diagrams to prove the correctness
of the algorithm for this example.
<p>
\(S_{1}\) be the elements over which the majority is taken to compute
\(a[1]\).
<p>
\(
S_{1} = m[1], a[2,1], a[3,1] = m[1], m[2,1], m[3,1]
\)
<p>So,
\(
S_{1} = m[1], m[2], m[3,1] = m^{*},  m^{*}, ?
\)
<p>
And therefore \(a[1] = m^{*}\). By the same argument, \(a[2] =
m^{*}\).
<p>
We see that in this example, loyal lieutenants obey the loyal
general. 

<h4 style="color:red;">Example: 4 officers, disloyal general.</h4>

The next diagram shows a situation in which the general is disloyal
while lieutenants 1, 2 and 3. The general sends unknown values to each
of the lieutenants. The unknown values are shown as messages colored
black, blue and red to lieutenants 1, 2, and 3
respectively. Lieutenants 1, 2
and 3 transmit the messages that they receive from the general, and so the
edges from \(m[1]\), \(m[2]\)  and \(m[3]\) are also black, blue, and
red, respectively.

<p>
The decisions \(a[1]\), \(a[2]\), and \(a[3]\) made by lieutenants 1,
2, and 3, are
computed as the majority of values in 1 black edge, 1 blue edge and 1
red edge. Regardless of what values are transmitted along these edges,
all the majorities are computed on identical sets, and so the results
are identical. So we
see that in this example, loyal lieutenants come to a consensus though
the general is disloyal.


<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.006.jpeg" alt="Fig6" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.5: Example with disloyal general</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let's use algebra rather than diagrams to prove the correctness
of the algorithm for this example.
<p>
Let \(S_{1}, S_{2}\) be the elements over which the majority is taken to compute
\(a[1], a[2]\), respectively.
<p>
\(
S_{1} = m[1], a[2,1], a[3,1] = m[1], m[2,1], m[3,1]
\)
<p>
\(
S_{2} = m[2], a[1,2], a[3,2] = m[2], m[1,2], m[3,2]
\)
<p>
Because lieutenants \(1, 2\) are loyal:
<p>
\(m[1] = m[1,2]\) and \(m[2] = m[2,1]\).

<p>
Therefore, \(S_{1} = S_{2}\),
and so \(a[1] = a[2]\).

<p>
By the same argument:
<p>
\(
a[1] = a[2] = a[3]
\)
<p>
So we
see that in this example, loyal lieutenants come to a consensus though
the general is disloyal.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">DataFlow</h4>
The flow of data in the steps of the algorithm help in understanding
the algorithm and its proof. If you wish you can skip this section and go directly
to the proof.

<p>
The vertices in the messaging and aggregation phases are labeled
\(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\), and \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) where the
\(i_{j}\) are distinct for \(1 \leq j \leq r\).
Lieutenant \(r\) receives message \(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) and
computes \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Messages</p>
\(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) for \(r > 1\) is a message sent by lieutenant
\(i_{r-1}\) to lieutenant \(i_{r}\). For \(r = 2\), think of the
message \(m[i_{1}, i_{2}]\), as the message that lieutenant \(i_{1}\)
tells lieutenant \(i_{2}\) that lieutenant \(i_{1}\) received from the
general. Likewise, for \(r > 2\), think of the
message \(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) as the message that lieutenant \(i_{r-1}\)
tells lieutenant \(i_{r}\) that lieutenant \(i_{r-1}\) received from
lieutenant \(i_{r-2}\) on a step.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local Computation</p>
The edges that represent dataflow within the same lieutenant are as
follows.
<ol>
  <li>
  from \(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) to \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\),
  dataflow local to lieutenant \(i_{r}\).
  </li>
  <li>
  for \(r > 1\):
  from \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}, i_{r+1}]\) to \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r-1},
  i_{r+1}]\),  dataflow local to lieutenant \(i_{r+1}\).
  </li>
</ol>
  
There is a dataflow edge from \(m[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\) to
\(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}]\). This edge represents local dataflow within
lieutenant \(i_{r}\). There is also a local dataflow edge from \(a[i_{1}, i_{2}]\) to
\(a[i_{2}]\) which represents computation within lieutenant \(i_{2}\).
Likewise, for \(r > 2\), there is a dataflow edge from
\(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r-1}, i_{r}]\) to \(a[i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r-2},
i_{r}]\). This edge also represents dataflow within lieutenant
\(i_{r}\). 


<h5  style="color:red;">Example: Dataflow with 7 lieutenants</h5>
Skip this example if the dataflow graph is clear.
The next diagrams illustrate messaging and aggregation phases for a
problem with 7 lieutenants. There are too many vertices to show all of them.

    <figcaption>Fig.8: Edges Aggregation Dataflow Trees
</figcaption>
</figure>


<h5  style="color:red;">Exercise</h5>
As an exercise, determine the data flowing along the edges of the
dataflow graph for two cases:
<ol>
  <li>
  Non-faulty general: agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are non-faulty and
  agents 5, 6 are faulty.
  </li>
  <li>
  Faulty general: agents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are non-faulty and
  agents 0, 6 are faulty.
  </li>
</ol>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
The proof that the algorithm is correct has two parts. The first part
deals only with validity, i.e., this part assumes that the general is loyal. The
second part deals with consensus as well as validity.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem 1: Validity</h4>
If the general is loyal and there are at \(m\) lieutenants where \(m
\geq 2 \times t + k\) and there are at most \(t\) disloyal lieutenants, then step
\(k\) satisfies validity.
<p>
Note that in step \(k\), algorithm \(B(k)\) is called \(m\) times.
<p>
The theorem is illustrated in the diagram below.
<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.009.jpeg" alt="Fig9" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.9: Edges Aggregation Dataflow Trees
</figcaption>
</figure>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
The proof is by induction. The base case is for \(k = 0\), and is
straightforward because when the general broadcasts message \(m*\):
<p>
\(\forall i: \; a[i] = m[i] = m*\)
<p>
as shown in the diagram below.


<figure>
    <img src="Byzantine_5/Byzantine_5.010.jpeg" alt="Fig10" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.10: Edges Aggregation Dataflow Trees
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Inductive step</p>
We assume that the theorem holds for all \(k < d\) and we prove that
the theorem holds for \(k = d\).

<p>
Let the message broadcast by the general be \(m^{*}\). We will prove
that for all loyal lieutenants \(j\): \(a[j] = m^{*}\)
<p>
In step \(k=d\) there are at least \(t+d\) loyal
lieutenants. Therefore in step \(d-1\) there are at least \(t+d-1\) loyal
lieutenants. So, for all loyal lieutenants \(i, j\):
<p>
\(a[i,j] = m^{*}\)
and
\(a[j] = m[j] = m^{*}\)
</p>
and
<p>
\(
a[j] = \textrm{majority}(m[j], \forall i \neq j : a[i, j])
\)
<p>
The majority is taken over at least \(t + d\) values equal to
\(m^{*}\). There are at most \(t\) values that are not 
\(m^{*}\), and \(d > 0\). So,
<p>
\(
a[j] = m^{*}
\)

<p>
The structure of message and local data flow in the proof is illustrated in the
diagram below.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem 2: Consensus</h4>
Step \(t\) satisfies the specification  if there are \(n\)   
officers (general and lieutenants) where \(n > 3.t\) and there are at
most \(t\) disloyal officers.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof</h5>
The proof is by induction.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Base Case \(t = 0\)</p>
Step (t=0) satisfies the specification when there are \(t=0\) faulty
agents. 


<p class="w3-text-teal">Induction Step</p>
We assume that the theorem holds \(t < d\) and we
prove the theorem for \(t = d\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Validity</p>
 The theorem applies to the case of at least \(3 \times t + 1\)
 officers. In this case there are at least \(2 \times t\) loyal
 lieutenants. 

<p>
From theorem 1, step \(d\) satisfies validity provided the number of
loyal lieutenants is at least \(t + d\) and the number of disloyal lieutenants is
at most \(t\).
Therefore, step \(t = d\) satisfies validity.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Consensus</p>
If the general is loyal, then consensus follows from validity: all
loyal lieutenants come to a consensus because all of them obey the general.

<p>
Next, we consider the case of a disloyal general. In this case there
are at most \(t - 1\) disloyal lieutenants.

<p>

Let \(j, k\) be loyal lieutenants. We will prove that they come to a
consensus, i.e.,
<p>
\(a[j] = a[k]\).
<p>
in step \(t = d\) assuming that the theorem holds for \(t = d-1\).

<p>
(Note: We have already considered the base case of \(t = 0\).)

<p>
Let \(i\) be a lieutenant who may be loyal or disloyal.
From the induction hypothesis, the theorem holds in step \(d
-1\). Therefore, the outputs of step \(d - 1\) satisfies the following
equations.
<p>
Because lieutenants \(j\) and \(k\) reach consensus in step \(d - 1\):
<br>
\(
a[i, j] = a[i, k]
\)

<p>
Because lieutenant \(j\) is loyal, it broadcasts the message that it
receives.
<br>
\(
a[j, k] = m[j, k] = m[j]
\)
<p>
Likewise, because lieutenant \(k\) is loyal:
\(
a[k, j] = m[k, j] = m[k]
\)

<p>
From the algorithm:
<p>
\(
a[j] = \; \textrm{majority}(m[j], (\forall i \neq  j: a[i, j]))
\)
<p>
\(
a[k] = \; \textrm{majority}(m[k], (\forall i \neq  k: a[i, k]))
\)
<p>
Let \(S_{i}, S_{j}\) be the sets of values over which majorities are taken to
compute \(a[i], a[j]\), respectively. Then, substituting for \(m[i]\)
and \(m[j]\):
<p>
\(
S_{i} = \; a[k,j], a[j, k],  (\forall i \notin  \{j, k\}: a[i, j]))
\)
<p>
\(
S_{j} = \; a[j,k], a[k, j],  (\forall i \notin  \{j, k\}: a[i, j]))
\)
<p>
Therefore \(S_{j} = S_{k}\) and 
\(
a[j] = a[k]
\).

<h4  style="color:red;">Example: Idea underlying proof</h4>
The next two diagrams illustrate the idea underlying the proof that
the algorithm satisfies the consensus requirement. The diagram below
shows the inductive assumption. The general is disloyal and sends unknown
messages (either attack or retreat) to the lieutenants. The loyal
lieutenants are shown to the left and disloyal ones to the right. The
loyal lieutenants come to a consensus and this consensus is shown as
purple-colored vertices for \(a[j]\) for loyal \(j\).

</figcaption>
</figure>

The next diagram illustrates the arguments in the inductive step.
This diagram
has 4 lieutenants with  3 loyal lieutenants to the left and a disloyal
one to the right. The loyal lieutenants are identified in the diagram
with "L" and the disloyal one with "D". The disloyal general sends
unkown messages to the lieutenants.

    <figcaption>Fig.13: Edges Aggregation Dataflow Trees
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Assume that the index of the leftmost lieutenant is 1.
This lieutenant gets a message \(m[1]\). The message (either attack
or retreat) is shown colored green.
Because the lieutenant is loyal, from theorem 1 on validity:
\(a[1,j] = m[1]\) for all loyal lieutenants \(j\). This is illustrated
by the green vertices output by step \(k-1\).

<p>
The same argument applies to the other loyal lieutenants; their
decisions are shown as blue and yellow output vertices of step \(k-1\)
where the colors represent the messages
that they received from the general.

<p>
Now consider the case of the disloyal lieutenant, which is shown as
the rightmost lieutenant. When this lieutenant acts as the general, by
the induction hypothesis, all loyal lieutenants come to a
consensus. The consensus value is shown as brown output vertices of
step \(k-1\).

<p>
The input to \(a[j]\) for every loyal lieutenant \(j\) is the same: one
green, one blue, one yellow, and one brown edge. So for all loyal
lieutenants \(i, j\): \(a[i] = a[j]\).

<h4  style="color:red;">Example: Disloyal general, 1 disloyal
lieutenant</h4>
The algorithm requires the number of loyal agents to be twice the
number of disloyal ones, and so the number of loyal agents is at least
5. Assume that lieutenant 1 is disloyal, and
lieutenants with index greater than 1 are loyal. We will show that for
loyal lieutenants 2, 3:
/(
a[2] = a[3]
\)
and the same argument can be used to show that all loyal agents come
to a consensus decision.
<p>
\(
a[2] = \textrm{maj}(m[2], a[1, 2], a[3, 2], a[4, 2], \ldots)
\)
<p>
\(
a[3] = \textrm{maj}(m[3], a[1, 3], a[2, 3], a[4, 3], \ldots)
\)
<p>
We will see that \(a[2] = a[3]\) by observing that for \(i \notin \{2, 3\}\):
<p>
\(
a[i, 2] = a[i, 3]
\)
<p>
and
\(m[2] = a[2, 3]\), and \(m[3] = a[3, 2]\)

<p  style="color:red;">Proof step</p>
We first show that for \(i \notin \{2, 3\}: a[i, 2] = a[i, 3] \).
<p>
\(
a[i,2]  =  \textrm{maj}(m[i, 2], a[i, 1, 2], a[i, 3, 2], a[i, 4, 2],
\ldots)
\)
<p>
\(
a[i,3]  =  \textrm{maj}(m[i, 3], a[i, 1, 3], a[i, 2, 3], a[i, 4, 3],
\ldots)
\)
<p>
We will see that \(m[i, 2] = a[i, 2, 3]\) and \(m[i, 3] = a[i, 3, 2]\)
and for \(i \notin \{2, 3\}\), all \(j\): \(a[i, j, 2] = a[i, j, 3]\).
<p>
\(
a[i, b, c] = \textrm{maj}(m[i, b, c], a[i, b, x, c], \forall d \notin
\{b, c\}: a[i, b, d, c]) =

<p>
\(
\textrm{maj}(m[i, b, c], a[i, b, x, c], \forall d \notin
\{b, c\}: m[i, b, d, c]) =

\(
m[i, c, d, e] = m[i, c]
\)

<p>
\(
m[b, c, d, e] = m[b, c, d] = m[b, c] = m[b]
\)

<p>
\(
m[b, c, x, e] = m[x, e]
