    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Consensus: Written
Messages</h1>

<p class="w3-text-red">
This module introduces Byzantine consensus algorithms in which agents
reach consensus in a sequence of synchronized rounds <i>even though some
agents don't follow the protocol</i>.
</p>


    In this module we study algorithms by which a collection of agents
    reach a consensus among alternative values.
    <a href="../Paxos/Paxos.html">The Paxos algorithm</a> is
    an example of how agents reach consensus.
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">
    Agents cannot reach consensus if message delays or agent
    operations are arbitrarily slow.</a> Next, we study a consensus
    algorithm in which message delays are bounded and in which agents
    are guaranteed to come to a consensus <i>even though some agents
    do not follow the protocol.</i>

    <p>
    The algorithm operates in a sequence of steps called <i>rounds</i>.
    All messages sent in a round are delivered in the next round.
    Agents execute actions in each round after receiving
    messages sent in the previous round; these actions may include
    sending messages. So, the Byzantine algorithm is synchronous.

    

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Generals Problem: Overview</h3>
    A general has \(N\) army units each of which is led by a
    lieutenant general, herafter referred to merely as lieutenant. We
    refer to the general and the lieutenants, collectively, as
    agents. An agent may be either loyal or disloyal. A loyal general
    gives the same command to all lieutenants. A loyal general's
    command is either <i>attack</i> or <i>retreat</i>.  A disloyal
    general may give different commands to different lieutenants and
    may give no commands to some. The lieutenants receive commands
    from the general and then communicate among themselves to reach a
    consensus.  Loyal lieutenants follow an algorithm while disloyal
    lieutenants may or may not.
    <p>
    The figure below illustrates the difference between loyal and
    disloyal generals.

    <figure>
    <img src="Slide01.jpg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.1: Loyal and disloyal general behavior</figcaption>
    </figure>

 


    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Byzantine Generals Problem:
Specification</h4>

<p>
  A loyal general sends attack messages to all lieutenants or sends
retreat messages to all lieutenants.

A disloyal general sends arbitrary messages to lieutenants.

    <ol>
      <li><i>Validity</i>: Loyal lieutenants must obey a loyal general. If a loyal general
    gives the command to attack then all loyal lieutenants must
    attack. Likewise, if a loyal general
    gives the command to retreat then all loyal lieutenants must
    retreat.</li>
      <li><i>Consensus</i>: Loyal lieutenants come to a consensus: either all of them
    attack or all of them retreat.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  
    The specification does not require that traitors be
    discovered. For example, the algorithm doesn't have to determine
    whether the general or a lieutenant is loyal or disloyal.

    <p>
    If the only requirement is validity, and consensus isn't
    required, then the solution is trivial: all loyal lieutenants obey
    the general whether the general is loyal or disloyal. If the only
    requirement is consensus then the
    solution is trivial: all loyal lieutenants agree on a predefined
    value, say retreat, regardless of the command issued by the
    general. The conjunction of both requirements makes the problem
  difficult.

  
    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Oral and Written Messages</h4>
  There are two versions of the problem.

  <ol>
    <li>
    <i>Written Messages</i>:
    In this version an agent may send copies of messages that it
    receives to other agents but cannot modify the
    messages. Also, an agent cannot forge signatures. So, an agent can
    receive a message M signed by lieutenant \(A\) only if \(A\) sent M to
    some agent.
    </li>
    <li>
    <i>Oral Messages</i>:
    In this version an agent can modify messages and forge
    signatures.So, an agent can receive a message M signed by agent
    \(A\) even if \(A\) never sent M to any agent.
    </li>
  </ol>
  The algorithm for written messages is simpler and requires fewer
    messages.


    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Algorithm with Written Messages</h2>

  <p>
A reliable lieutenant who does not get a message from in round 0 treats the
absence of the message as the same as receiving a retreat message.
  Likewise, if a loyal lieutenant gets a message that is not an attack
  or a retreat message then the lieutenant treats the message as a
  retreat message.

  (We use retreat as a default. We could just as well have used attack
  as the default.)

  <p>
  Next, we give an overview of the algorithm.

  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Commit to Attack</h5>
  At each round in the algorithm, a loyal lieutenant has either
  committed to attack or not.

  A lieutenant that has not committed to attack on a round may commit
  to attack on a later round.

  If any loyal lieutenant commits to attack in any round then it remains
  committed to attack thereafter.
  A loyal lieutenant retreats if it has not committed to attack at the
  end of the last round.

  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Messages</h5>
  A message is an attack message from the general or a commitment to
  attack by a lieutenant. We call commitment messages
  attack messages. An attack message is identified by the
  agent (general or lieutenant) that created the message.

  <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Evidence for Attack</h5>
  A loyal lieutenant commits to attack on round \(r \geq 1 \), for the first
  time, if the lieutenant has received an attack message from the
  general and at
  least \(r - 1\) lieutenants. 
  When the lieutenant commits to attack it sends copies of these
  messages, and its own attack message, to all
  other lieutenants.
  So, in round \(r+1\), each lieutenant receives an attack messages from
  the general and at least \(r\)
  lieutenants.
  And so, all loyal lieutenants commit to attack in this round.


  <h4 class="w3-text-teal">The Algorithm</h4>
  We will use the tactic that is helpful in analyzing distributed
algorithms that operate in rounds.
We will prove properties of a sequential algorithm and then show the
  equivalence of the sequential and distributed algorithms.
The sequential algorithm is given next.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Local Variables</p>
  Associated with each lieutenant <code>C</code> are local variables
<code>C.received</code> and <code>C.sent</code> which are sets of
  agents (general or lieutenants).

<code>C.received</code> is the set of agents from which 
<code>C</code> has received attack messages (or their copies).

<code>C</code> sends attack messages (or copies) from agents in
<code>C.sent</code>.

The symbol <code>g</code> represents the general.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Initialization: Round 0</h5>
<code>A.sent = {}</code> for all lieutenants
<code>A</code>.

<ol>
  <li>
  If the general is loyal and sends attack messages then the set of
  agents from which a lieutenant has received attack messages is the
  singleton set consisting of the general. So, for all
  lieutenants <code>A</code>:
  <br>
  <code>A.received = {g}</code>
  </li>
  <li>
  If the general is loyal and sends retreat messages then for all
  lieutenants <code>A</code>:
  <br>
  <code>A.received = {}</code>
  </li>
  <li>
  If the general is disloyal, then 
  <code>A.received = {g}</code> for some lieutenants <code>A</code>,
  and <code>A.received = {}</code> for the others.
  </li>
</ol>
  
The algorithm operates in a sequence of rounds with round-number
<code>r</code> stepping from 1 to <code>t+1</code>. The
<code>r</code>-th iteration for loyal agent <code>c</code> consists of
the following two steps.
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Round <code>r > 0</code></h5>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Step 1</p>
<pre>
if (|C.received| >= r) AND  (g in C.received):
    C.commit = True
    C.sent = C.received UNION {C}
</pre>
If <code>C.received</code> has messages that show that:  (1) the number of
agents that have committed to attack on round
<code>r</code> is at least <code>r</code>, and (2) the general has sent an
attack message, then <code>C</code> commits to attack and sends these
messages as well as an additional message that <code>C</code> has
committed to attack.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Step 2</p>
<pre>
C.received = (
    (UNION over all loyal agents B of B.sent)
             UNION
     an arbitrary subset of disloyal agents)
</pre>
<code>C</code> receives the messages sent by loyal lieutenants and messages
sent by disloyal lieutenants.

A disloyal lieutenant, <code>A</code>, can send messages to some lieutenants
that <code>A</code> is committed to attack, and not send these messages
to other lieutenants.

Lieutenant <code>C</code> receives attack messages from an arbitrary subset
of disloyal lieutenants.

<p>
Lieutenant <code>C</code> does not know which agents are loyal and
which are disloyal.

<code>C.received</code> is the set of all messages sent to
<code>C</code> regardless of whether the senders are loyal or
disloyal.



<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Correctness</h3>
<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Case 1: General is loyal and sends attack
messages</h5>
In this case, at the start round 1, <code>C.received = {g}</code>.

So, the if-clause in step 1 of round 1 is True, and therefore all
loyal lieutenants commit to attack at the end of round 1.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Case 2: General is loyal and sends retreat
messages</h5>
A disloyal lieutenant cannot forge the general's signature, and so it is
impossible for any lieutenant to have a copy of an attack message from the
general.
Therefore the if-clause of step 1 is never satisfied, and so no loyal
lieutenant commits to attack in any step.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Case 3: General is disloyal</h5>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 1</p>
We first show that if any loyal lieutenant commits on round
<code>r</code> then all loyal lieutenants commit by the end of round
<code>r+1</code>.

<p>
A loyal lieutenant <code>C</code> commits on round <code>r</code>
exactly when the set <code>C.received</code> has at least
<code>r</code> attack messages including one from the general.
So, in round <code>r</code>, <code>C.sent</code> has at least
<code>r+1</code> attack messages including one from the general.
Therefore, the if-clause of step 1 evaluates to True in round
<code>r+1</code>, and so all
loyal lieutenants commit by the end of round <code>r+1</code>.

<p>
Therefore, if any loyal lieutenant commits by the end of round
<code>t-1</code> then all loyal lieutenants commit by the end of round
<code>t</code>.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 2</p>
We next show that if no loyal lieutenant has committed by the end of
round <code>t-1</code> then no loyal lieutenant commits in round
<code>t</code>.

<p>
<code>C.sent = {}</code> at the end
of round <code>t-1</code> if no loyal lieutenant has committed to
attack.
Therefore in round <code>t</code>,
<code>C.received</code> is an 
arbitrary subset of disloyal lieutenants.
There are at most <code>t-1</code> disloyal lieutenants because there
are at most <code>t</code> disloyal agents, and the general is
disloyal.
So, on round <code>t</code>, the if-clause of step 1 evaluates to False.
<p>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part 3</p>
From parts 1 and 2, by the end of
round <code>t</code>, either all loyal lieutenants commit, or no loyal
lieutenant commits.


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>

The figure below illustrates a situation in which a loyal lieutenant C commits to
attack on round 3, if it hasn't already committed to attack on rounds
1 and 2.
The figure shows C getting attack messages (red boxes) signed by the
general and lieutenants A and B on round 2. The general and
lieutenants A and B may be disloyal or loyal.

    <figure>
    <img src="Slide02.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig.2: Example of a lieutenant committing to attack</figcaption>
</figure>

 

<p>
 Because C is loyal it follows the algorithm, and C
commits to attack at the end of round 3 because C receives a signed attack
 message from the general and signed attack messages from two
 different lieutenants.
So, in round 3, C broadcasts copies of attack messages
signed by the general and attack
messages signed by A and B and attack messages, and also an attack
 message signed by C itself. All loyal
lieutenants commit to attack in round 4 because they receive attack
messages signed by the general and 3 different lieutenants (A, B, C).



<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  Assume that you are explaining the algorithm to someone who hasn't
  taken a course on distributed computing. How would you explain to
  this person that even if the general and 999 lieutenants are
  disloyal, and only 2 lieutenants are loyal, the loyal lieutenants
  reach a consensus after round 100? 
  (Remember the first round is round 0.)
  <li>
  Will the algorithm work if at most one lieutenant could modify
  written messages, and all the other lieutenants followed the
  protocol, i.e. these lieutenants could copy but not modify
  messages. 
  </li>
</ol>
