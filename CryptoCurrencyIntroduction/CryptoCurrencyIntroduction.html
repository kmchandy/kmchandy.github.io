    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction to Cryptography for
    Cryptocurrency</h3>

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Review: Cryptographic Hash Function</h3>
    A  hash function, \(H\), maps input strings of
    arbitrary size to outputs of 
    fixed size, does so efficiently. Let \(n\) be the number of output
    bits of \(H\).

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Collision Resistance</h4>
    Input values \(x, y\) are said to <i>collide</i> when \(H(x) = H(y)\).

    <p>
    Let's look at the following problem: Given \(H\), find any
    colliding pair \(x, y\).
    
    Let's look at a brute-force algorithm to solve this
    problem. Suppose \(n\) is \(3\). We could compute hash values for
    all \(8\) input strings of length \(3\) and one input string of
    length \(4\). From the pigeon-hole principle, if \(9\) inputs are
    mapped to \(8\) possible outputs then at least two of the inputs
    must have the same output. So, we can solve the problem in at most
    \(9\) steps.

    <p>
    We can find collisions, using this brute-force algorithm, for any
    \(n\); however, the computation time is of the order of
    \(2^{n}\). Are there fast ways of finding collisions where the
    computation time is polynomial rather than exponential in \(n\)?
    That depends on the hash function.

    <p>
    A hash functions is said to be <i>collision resistant</i> if 
    the only known ways of
    finding collisions in the hash functions are about as slow as
    the brute force algorithm. 
    

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Hiding</h4>
    Your soccer friend predicts the winner, \(W\), of the 2022 World
    Cup. She tells you the hash function, \(H\), and gives you the
    hash, \(y\), where \(y = H(W)\).
     After the World Cup is over, she
    reveals her prediction, \(W\), by showing that \(H(W)\) is indeed
    \(y\). That's one way of making a commitment and revealing it
    later. 

    <p>
    Can you discover her prediction before she reveals it?

    <p>
It's easy. There are only 32 teams playing. Compute \(H(x)\) where
    \(x\) runs over each of the 32 teams. One of those teams has to be
    \(W\). You can discover her prediction in at most 32 steps.

    <p>
    If you believe that she will pick Brazil with high
    probability, then your expected time to discover her prediction
    will be even faster if you begin by checking: \(H(Brazil) \stackrel{?}{=} y\). 

<p>
Let's modify the problem.  She selects a secret value \(r\). Instead
of giving you \(H(W)\), she gives you \(y\) where \(y = H(r + W)\) and
where \(_\) indicates concatenation of strings. But, she doesn't give you \(r\). Can
you discover \(W\) from \(H\) and \(H(r + W)\)?

<p>
Let's modify the problem further.Suppose that you are certain that she predicted the
winner to be Brazil. All you have to do to prove that she predicted
Brazil is to find an \(r\) such that \(H(r + Brazil) = y\).
How easy is finding such an \(r\)?

<p>
That depends on the distribution from which \(r\) is picked. If \(r\)
is the string "password" with probability 0.999 then you are likely to
find \(r\) with high probability.
If, however, the distribution from which \(r\) is picked is
spread out, then \(r\) is unpredictable, and finding \(r\) is
infeasible. 

<p>
A hash function, \(H\) is said to be <i>hiding</i> exactly when all
algorithms to compute \(x\), given only \(H(r+x)\) and \(H\), take so
much time that solving the problem is practically impossible ---
provided that \(r\) is picked from a spread-out distribution.
    

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Puzzle Friendly</h4>
Let \(r\) be a value picked from a spread-out distribution. Let \(Y\)
    be a set of \(n\)-bit values. Consider the following problem:
    Given \(H\), and \(Y\), compute any \(x\) such that \(H(r+x) \in
Y\).

<p>
The hash function, \(H\), is said to be <i>puzzle friendly</i>
    exactly when any algorithm to solve this problem is not much
    better than the brute force algorithm that tries every possible
    value of \(x\). In other words, the number of steps taken by any
algorithm that solves this problem is not significantly lower than \(2^{n}\).

<p>
If  we are testing random values of
\(x\) to find out if \(H(x) \in Y\) then if
set \(Y\) has two elements, we
we expect that solving the problem
will take about half as much time as for the case where \(Y\) has only
element. So, the cardinality of \(Y\) gives us an easy way of controlling
the expected time to solve the problem.

<p>
<i>A cryptographic hash function is one that is collision resistant,
hiding and puzzle-friendly.
</i>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Hashing Inputs of Arbitrary Length</h3>
Let \(f\) be a function that operates on input strings
of fixed length and produces output strings of fixed length. Let the
input and output strings of \(f\) have lengths \(M + N\) and \(M\),
respectively. We look at functions where \(N > 0\), and since the
output is smaller than the input, \(f\) is called a <i>compression
function.</i>

<p>
Let \(g\) be a function that operates on input strings of arbitrary
lengths. Example code is given below where <code>InitialValue</code>
is a given constant string.

<pre>
def g(y):
    output = InitialValue

    // pad y so that it's length is a multiple of N
    if len(y)%N > 0:  y = y + "0"*(N - len(y)%N)

    // partition y into blocks of size N
    blocks = [y[i: i+N] for i in range(0, len(y), N)]

    for block in blocks: output = f(output+block)
    return output
</pre>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Hash Pointers</h3>
A hash pointer is a pair \(ptr, y\) where \(ptr\) is a pointer that
points to an item of data, and \(y\) is a cryptographic hash of that
item of data. Any data structure with pointers can be converted into a
data structure with hash pointers replacing pointers.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Tamper-Evident Linear Lists</h3>
Let's look at the familiar linear linked list.
Each element of the linear linked list contains two parts: data and
a pointer to the next element of the linked list. Consider a linked
list to which elements can be appended but not deleted. Let's call the
very first element in the list the <i>genesis</i> element, or the \(0\)-th
element, when the list is not empty.
Let's call the element whose pointer points to the \(i\)-th element, 
the \(i+1\)-th element.
When we replace the pointer part of the familiar list by a hashed
pointer we get a <i>tamper-evident linear list.</i>

<p>
The \(i+1\)-th element consists of (1) data, \(D[i+1]\), (2) a pointer
\(ptr[i+1]\) to the location of the \(i\)-th element and (3) a hash
\(H[i+1]\) of the \(i\)-th element.  The pointer of the \(0\)-th
element is <code>None</code> or some symbol that indicates empty.

<p>
If \(D[i]\), \(ptr[i]\) or
\(H[i]\) are changed then the changed values will not match
\(H[i+1]\). This is because collisions are
 unlikely, and so the hashes of the original and modified
values are unlikely to be identical.

<p>
We can detect changes
to \(D[i]\), \(ptr[i]\) or \(H[i]\) unless \(H[i+1]\) is also modified
to match the changes. By induction on \(i\), we can detect
changes to any \(D[i]\), \(ptr[i]\) or \(H[i]\), unless \(H[j]\)
<i>for all \(j > i\)</i> are also modified to match the changes.
So we can detect any change to
the list provided that \(H[n]\) --- the pointer
to the last element --- cannot be changed. 


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Tamper-Evident Acyclic Graphs and Merkle
Trees</h3>
The idea described in the previous paragraph to convert linear linked
lists can be used to convert directed acyclic graphs, in which nodes are
connected by pointers, into tamper-evident graphs. A specific case of
a directed acyclic graph is a rooted tree.

<p>
A <i>Merkle tree</i> is a special case of a binary balanced tree in
data items are stored only in the leaves, while the other nodes of the
tree contain only hash pointers to nodes in the next level down. The
length of a path from the root to a leaf is \(log_{2}(n)\) where \(n\)
is the number of leaves. So, to
prove that an element at the leaf is a member of the tree we need only
\(log_{2}(n)\) elements on the path from the root to that leaf. 

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Keys and Signed Messages</h3>
You can create a random public-key, private-key pair 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen">
by calling a function on your computer.</a>
With high probability, nobody else has this
specific pair of keys. Each individual's private key is a secret held
by that individual. Public keys are accessible by everybody.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Sending messages securely</p>
Keys are used to send messages securely.
Kamala sends a secure message to Joe by encrypting the message with
Joe's public key; Joe decrypts the message using Joe's private key.
An agent cannot decrypt the encrypted message without Joe's private key.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Signing messages</p>
Suppose Kamala needs to send a signed message to Joe while
ensuring that nobody can forge her signature. She encrypts the message
<i>M</i> with her private key to get an encrypted message <i>M'</i>,
and sends the pair <i>(M, M')</i> securely to Joe. When Joe receives
<i>(M, M')</i>, Joe decrypts
<i>M'</i> using Kamala's public key to get the decrypted message
<i>M''</i>. If <i>M'' = M</i> then Joe knows that Kamala sent
<i>M</i> because only an agent with Kamala's private signature could
have sent that message.
