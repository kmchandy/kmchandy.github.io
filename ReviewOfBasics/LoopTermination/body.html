<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Loop Termination: Variant Functions</h1>
We prove that most algorithms terminate by using loop variants.
We use the term variant function, rather than loop variant,
because we will use the concept to prove termination of loops as well as
termination of systems that are not loops.

<p>
<i>A variant function is a function
from states of a system to a well-founded set.</i>

    A
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation">
    well-founded set</a>
    is a set on which we can carry out proofs by
    induction. In this course we generally use well-founded sets that are
    integers or vectors of integers, and that are bounded below.
We compare vectors
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order">
lexicographically</a>. For example \((0, 2) < (1, 0)\).
    
    <p>
    Let \(f\) be a variant function. Then \(f = k\), for a constant
    \(k\) is a predicate. The extension of this predicate is the set
    of states \(s\) where \(f(s) = k\).

    We prove that execution of a loop terminates by proving that the
    execution of any command whose guard evaluates to True reduces the
    value of a variant function \(f\).

<hr class="new2">
    <p>

     If the execution of any command with a True guard reduces
    \(f\) then every iteration
    reduces 
\(f\). Since \(f\) is bounded below, it cannot decrease forever.
Therefore, the computation terminates, and when it does
all guards are False.



    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variant Functions and Hoare Triples</h4>
    Let \(I\) be an invariant
     of the loop, let the \(j\)-th guarded command have guard
    \(g_{j}\) and command \(c_{j}\), and let \(f\) be a variant function
    of the loop. We prove that the execution of any command with
    a True guard reduces the variant function by proving the
    following Hoare triple for all \(j\): 
<p>
\(\forall K: \quad
\{(f = k) \wedge I \wedge g_{j}\} \; c_{j} \; \{f < k\}
\)
<p>
Because \(I\) is an invariant it holds before every command is
    executed. Since \(c_{j}\) is executed only if \(g_{j}\) holds, we
    know that \(I \wedge g_{j}\) holds before \(c_{j}\) is
executed.
Execution of the command reduces the variant function from \(k\) to
    some smaller value.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Variant Functions and Graphs</h3>
If an algorithm has a variant function \(f\) then all paths in
from initial vertices are cycle-free.
This is because every edge on the path is from a state with a higher
value of \(f\) to a state with a lower value.
The diagram below shows an acyclic graph with edges directed from
higher to lower \(f\) values.

<p>
A terminal state (vertex) is one without outgoing edges.
The existence of a variant function tells us that a terminal state is
reached from an initial state in a finite number of state transitions.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
We will use variant functions to prove that distributed algorithms
progress towards their goals.
The concept of variant functions in sequential programming is a
central concept in reasoning about progress of distributed systems.
