    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h2>
    Let \(x\) be a vector of positive integers. Does the following
    nondeterministic iteration terminate? If so, what is \(x\) upon
    termination? Prove your answer.
    <p>
    \(x\) has \(N\) elements indexed \(j\) where \(0 \leq j < N\).
    <p>
    for all \(0 \leq i, j < N\):
    <p>
    \(
    x[j] > x[i] \quad \rightarrow \quad x[j] = x[j] - x[i]
    \)

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 2</h2>
    <p>
    This question is related to the distributed algorithm,
    <i>Diffusing Computations</i>.
    <p>
    \(T\) is either empty or is a rooted tree with vertex \(root\) as the
    root. Associated with each vertex
    \(v\) on the tree is a variable \(v.parent\) which is
    \(v\)'s parent in the tree if \(v\) is not the root, and is
    \(None\) if \(v\) is the root. Because the tree is rooted, \(root\)
    is an ancestor of all vertices on the tree.

    <p>
    Also associated with
    each vertex \(v\) is an integer, \(v.count\), which is the number
    of \(v\)'s children on the tree.
    <p>
    A vertex that is not in \(T\) has a zero count and no parent.
    <p>
    Consider the following algorithm:
    <p>
    For all vertices <code>v</code>
    <pre>
    (v.count == 0) and (v.parent != None)   ->
                           v.parent.count -= 1
                           v.parent = None
    </pre>
    <p>
    Does the algorithm terminate? Prove your answer.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 1</h2>
    Yes, the algorithm terminates.
    <p>
    An invariant of the algorithm is that all elements of \(x\) are
    positive integers. Verify that this predicate holds initially and execution of
all commands maintains this predicate.
<p>
Let \(f = \sum_{j} x[j]\)
<p>
\(f\) is bounded below by \(N\) because of the invariant.
\(f\) has an integer value.
<p>
Verify that execution of any command with a True guard reduces
    \(f\). Therefore \(f\) is a variant function, and the algorithm
terminates.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Termination Condition</p>
If all the guards are False then all the elements of \(x\) are
identical. Verify the invariant that the gcd (greatest common divisor)
of the elements of \(x\) remain unchanged. Therefore, at termination,
each element of \(x\) is the gcd of initial elements of \(x\).

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Question 2</h2>
Yes, the algorithm terminates.
<p>
A guard has value True exactly when \(v\) is a leaf of the tree, and
executing the command removes \(v\) from the tree.
<p>
A variant function is the number of vertices in the tree. This is
bounded below by 0, and execution of a command with a True guard
reduces its value.
<p>
At termination the tree vanishes.

<p class="w3-text-teal">An alternate variant function</p>
An alternate variant function is the tree, T, itself. For any graphs
\(G\), \(G'\), define \(G \leq G'\) exactly when \(G\) is a subraph of
\(G'\). This variant function is bounded below by the empty tree, and
the execution of a command with a True guard reduces the function.
