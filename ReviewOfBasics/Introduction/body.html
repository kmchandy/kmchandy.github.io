  Sequential algorithms are the foundation for distributed
  algorithms.
  Similar methods are used to design and reason about both
  sequential and distributed algorithms.

  <a href="Loops/Loops.html">Nondeterministic iteration</a>,
  in the form of Dijkstra's <i>do-od loop</i>, is a central concept in
  both sequential and distributed algorithms.
  The model of concurrent computation used in this course is
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/59087">UNITY</a>,
  an extension of the <i>do-od loop</i>.
  We reason about both sequential and distributed algorithms by
  analyzing computations - sequences of program states.
