<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Consider a program with integer variables \(x, y\).
The state of the program is given by the value of the tuple \(x, y\).
The <i>universal set</i> is the set of all possible values of \(x,
y\).

<p>

Each state is represented by a point \(x, y\) in the plane.
The universal set is shown as the red box that bounds the values that
integers take in the program.

<p>
The set of states for which a predicate holds is called the extension
of the predicate. The
extension of the predicate \(x = 0\) is shown by the vertical blue
line, \(x = 0\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \(y = 0\) is shown by the horizontal blue
\(y = 0\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \wedge(y = 0)\) is shown by the blue
square in the right most diagram: the box is at the intersection of
\((x = 0)\) and \((y = 0)\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \vee (y = 0)\) is shown by the blue
horizontal and vertical lines in the rightmost diagram; this set is
the union of the sets 
corresponding to
\((x = 0)\) and \((y = 0)\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \equiv (y = 0)\) is shown in the blue
spaces in the rightmost diagram. A state satisfies this predicate exactly
when:
<p>
\(
((x \neq 0) \wedge (y \neq 0)) \vee ((x = 0) \wedge (y = 0))
\)

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \Rightarrow (y = 0)\) is shown in the blue
spaces in the figure below. A state satisfies this predicate exactly
when:

\(
(x \neq 0) \vee (y = 0))
