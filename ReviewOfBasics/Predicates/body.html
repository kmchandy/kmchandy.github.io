 In this course, a 
 <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">predicate
 </a>
 is a function from states of a program to
the Boolean constants \(\{True, False\}\).
The state of a program is given by the values of its variables; so, a
 predicate is a function from the variables of a program to the
Booleans.
For example, \(x > y\) is a predicate where the predicate is true in
 the state \((x, y) = (1, 0)\) and is false in the state \((x, y) =
 (0, 1)\). 


</p>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Set of elements associated with a predicate</p>
A predicate \(P\) defines a set, \(e(P)\), of elements
for which \(P\) holds.
\(e(P)\) is called the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(predicate_logic)">
extension
</a>
of \(P\).
<p>
\(
e(P) = \{v | P(v) \}
\)
<p>
For example \((1, 0)\) is a member of \(e(x > y)\) whereas \((0, 1)\)
is not. 
</p>

<p>
Disjunction (<i>or</i>, \(\vee\)) and conjunction  (<i>and</i>,
\(\wedge\)) of predicates correspond to union \(\cup\) and 
intersection \(\cap\), respectively, of the corresponding sets of
elements. 
<p>
\(
e(P \vee Q) \; = e(P) \cup e(Q)
\)
<br>
\(
e(P \wedge Q) \; = e(P) \cap e(Q)
\)
    <p>
True is a predicate whose extension is the universal set.
False is a predicate whose extension is the empty set.
    </p>

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Implication and Equivalence</h5>
For a state \(s\), the predicate \(P \Rightarrow Q\) holds in \(s\)
    exactly when \(P(s)\) is false or \(Q(s)\) is true.
    \(P \Rightarrow Q\), read as "\(P\) implies \(Q\)," is a predicate
which is equivalent to \(\neg P \vee Q\).
</p>
<p>
The predicate \(P \equiv Q\) holds in a state \(s\)
    exactly when \(P(s) = Q(s)\), and 
is equivalent to \( (P \wedge Q) \vee (\neg P \wedge \neg Q)\).

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Predicates and Booleans</h5>
<p>
Let \(P\) be a predicate.
We use Edsger W. Dijkstra's notation of square
brackets, \([P]\), to refer to the <i>boolean</i>:
<i>\(P\) is universally True</i>, i.e., the extension of
\(P\) is the universal set.

<p>
The types of \(P\) and \([P]\) are different.
The predicate \(P\) is a function from states to the
booleans. By contrast, \([P]\) is not a function; it is a boolean.
When we say "\([P]\) holds" we mean that the predicate \(P\) holds
universally. 
</p>

<p>
For example, "\([P \Rightarrow Q]\) holds" exactly when the set of states
in which \(P\) holds is a subset of the set of states in which \(Q\)
holds:
\(e(P) \subseteq e(Q)\)
<p>
Likewise "\([P \equiv Q]\) holds" exactly when the set of states
in which \(P\) holds is identical to the set of states in which \(Q\)
holds:
\(e(P) = e(Q)\)
<p>


<h3 style="color:red;">Example</h3>
Consider a program with integer variables \(x, y\).
The state of the program is given by the value of the tuple \(x, y\).
The <i>universal set</i> is the set of all possible values of \(x,
y\).

<p>

Each state is represented by a point \(x, y\) in the plane.
The universal set is shown as the red box that bounds the values that
integers take in the program.

<p>
The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \(x = 0\) is shown by the vertical blue
line, \(x = 0\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \wedge(y = 0)\) is shown by the blue
square in the right most diagram: the box is at the intersection of
\((x = 0)\) and \((y = 0)\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \vee (y = 0)\) is shown by the blue
horizontal and vertical lines in the rightmost diagram; this set is
the union of the sets 
corresponding to
\((x = 0)\) and \((y = 0)\).

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \equiv (y = 0)\) is shown in the blue
spaces in the rightmost diagram. A state satisfies this predicate exactly
when:
<p>
\(
((x \neq 0) \wedge (y \neq 0)) \vee ((x = 0) \wedge (y = 0))
\)

The set of states which is the
extension of the predicate \((x = 0) \Rightarrow (y = 0)\) is shown in the blue
spaces in the figure below. A state satisfies this predicate exactly

<p style="color:red;">Example:Square bracket notation</p>
The blue rectangle in the top box in the diagram below shows the
extension of the predicate \(x \geq 0\). The same blue rectange is also the
extension of the predicate \(\neg(x < 0)\).
<p>
The predicate \((x \geq 0) \; \equiv \; \neg(x < 0)\) holds at every
point: it is universally true.
The points where the predicate is true are shown in blue, and because
the predicate is true everywhere, the entire lower box (universal set)
is blue.
<p>
The boolean \([(x \geq 0) \; \equiv \; \neg(x < 0)]\)
is true.

The extension of the predicate \(((x \geq 0) \wedge (y \geq 0))\) is
the set <i>B</i> shown in the figure in the top right.
The extension of the predicate \((x \geq 0) \) is
the set <i>A</i> shown in the figure in the top left.
<i>B</i> is a subset of <i>A</i>.

The predicate \(((x \geq 0) \wedge (y \geq 0)) \; \Rightarrow \; (x > 0)\) is universally
true and so the entire box in the lower diagram is blue.
The boolean \([((x \geq 0) \wedge (y \geq 0)) \; \Rightarrow \; (x > 0)]\)
is true.
