<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Predicates on States</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
The state of a program is given by the values of its variables.
We reason about the correctness of programs by reasoning about sets of
program states.
For example, we will prove properties of a program such as:
all states in all computations that start from any state in a set
<i>init</i> of states  are in a set <i>safe</i>.
<p>
We use operations, such as union and intersection, on sets of
states. For example, for a program with variables <code>x, y, z</code> the
set <i>safe</i> may be defined as the 
intersection of the set of states in which  <code>x > y</code> and the
set in which <code>y > z</code>.

<p>
In this course, a 
 <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">predicate
 </a>
is a function from states of a program to
the Boolean constants \(\{True, False\}\).
For example, for a program with variables
<code>x, y</code>, the predicate <code>x > y</code> is true in
 the state <code>(x, y) = (1, 0)</code> and is false in the state
<code>(x, y) = (1, 1)</code>. 


</p>

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Set of elements associated with a predicate</p>
A predicate \(P\) on states of a program defines a set of states
for which \(P\) holds. 
For example, for a program with variables <code>(x, y)</code>, the
state <code>(x, y) = (1, 0)</code> is a member of the set of states
for which the
predicate <code>x > y</code> whereas <code>(x, y) = (0, 1)</code> is
not.

<p>
Disjunction (<i>or</i>, \(\vee\)) and conjunction  (<i>and</i>,
\(\wedge\)) of predicates correspond to the union \(\cup\) and 
intersection \(\cap\), respectively, of the corresponding sets of states.
True is a predicate whose extension is the universal set, and
False is a predicate whose extension is the empty set.
