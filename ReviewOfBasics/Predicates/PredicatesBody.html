<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Predicates on States</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
This module is a review of predicates on states of programs.

<p>
The state of a program is given by the values of its variables.
We will use set operations, such as union and intersection, on sets of
states.
For this course, a 
 <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">predicate
 </a>
is a function from states of a program to
the Boolean constants \(\{True, False\}\).
For example, for a program with variables
<code>x, y</code>, the predicate <code>x > y</code> is true in
 the state <code>(x, y) = (1, 0)</code> and is false in the state
<code>(x, y) = (1, 1)</code>. 


    <p class="w3-text-teal">Set of elements associated with a predicate</p>
Associated with a predicate \(P\) is a set of all the states of a
program for which \(P\) holds; this set is called the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(predicate_logic)">
extension of predicate \(P\)
</a>.


Disjunction (<i>or</i>), conjunction  (<i>and</i>) and negation
(<i>not</i>) of predicates
correspond to the union
intersection, and complement, respectively, of the corresponding sets of states.
The extensions of the predicates True and False are the universal and
empty sets, respectively.

<p>
For convenience, we use predicates more often than sets of states.
