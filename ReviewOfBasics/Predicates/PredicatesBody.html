This module is a review of predicates on states of programs.
</h5>

<p>
In this course, a 
 <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">predicate
 </a>
is a function from states of a program to
the Boolean constants \(\{True, False\}\).
For example, for a program with variables
<code>x, y</code>, the predicate <code>x > y</code> is true in
 the state <code>(x, y) = (1, 0)</code> and is false in the state
<code>(x, y) = (1, 1)</code>.

<p>
For a predicate \(P\) and a state \(s\), the value of the predicate at
state \(s\) is written \(P(s)\), which is a Boolean.
We say that "\(P\) holds in state \(s\)" exactly when \(P(s)\) is
True.

<p>
Boolean operators such as disjunction (<i>or</i>)
are "lifted" to be operators on predicates:
the predicate \(P \vee Q\) holds in a state \(s\) exactly
when \(P(s) \vee Q(s)\) holds.
Likewise, the predicate \(P \wedge Q\) holds in a state \(s\) exactly
when \(P(s) \wedge Q(s)\) holds.


    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Set of states corresponding to a predicate</h4>
Associated with a predicate \(P\) is a set of all the states of a
program for which \(P\) holds; this set is called the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(predicate_logic)">
extension of predicate \(P\)
</a> .
The extension of \(P\) is the set \(\{s | P(s)\}\).
We use the phrase "set of states corresponding to \(P\)" for the
extension of \(P\).

<p>
Disjunction, conjunction, and negation of predicates
correspond to the union
intersection, and complement, respectively, of the corresponding sets
of states. Let \(e(P)\) be the extension of \(P\). Then
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Disjunction</i>:
  \(e(P \vee Q) \; = \; e(P) \cup e(Q)\)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Conjunction</i>:
  \(e(P \wedge Q) \; = \; e(P) \cap e(Q)\)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>Negation</i>:
  \(e(\neg P) \; = \; \overline{e(P)}\)
  </li>
</ol>
The
<a href="./Predicates_Examples.html">module on predicate examples</a>
has Venn diagrams illustrating these concepts.
