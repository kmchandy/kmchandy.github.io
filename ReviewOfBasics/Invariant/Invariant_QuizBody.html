<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h3>
True or False? Explain your answer.
<p>
\(
stable(P) \wedge stable(Q) \quad \Rightarrow \quad stable(P \wedge Q)
\)

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
True
<p>
All transitions from states in which \(P\) holds are to states in
which \(P\) holds.
All transitions from states in which \(Q\) holds are to states in
which \(Q\) holds.
Therefore
all transitions from states in which \(P \wedge Q\) holds are to states in
which \(P \wedge Q\) holds.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h3>
True or False? Explain your answer.
<p>
\(
stable(P \wedge Q) \quad \Rightarrow \quad stable(P) \wedge stable(Q)
\)

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
False
<p>
Suppose \(P\) holds in  \(\{v, w\}\), and \(Q\) in  \(\{w\}\),
and therefore \(P \wedge Q\) holds  in
\(\{w\}\).
<p>
Assume transitions from \(w\) are to \(w\), and so
\(stable(P \wedge Q)\).
<p>
The transition from \(v\) could be to a state other than \(v, w\).
in which case \(\{v, w\}\) is not stable.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
do
  x = 0 -> x = 0
  x = 1 -> x = 2
od
</pre>
\(x = 0\), i.e., \(Q\) is stable but \((x = 0) \vee (x = 1)\),
i.e. \(P\) is not stable. The left-hand side --- "\(stable(P \wedge
Q)\) --- of the implication is true but the right-hand side
--- \(stable(P) \wedge stable(Q)\) --- is false. 

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h3>
A predicate \(I\) is an invariant for a program where the initial
condition is \((x = 0) \vee (x = 1)\). Is \(I\) also an invariant for
the same program if the initial condition is tightened to \(x = 0\)?
Explain

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
Yes, \(I\) is an invariant with the tighter initial condition.
<p>
All states in all paths from states in which \((x = 0) \vee (x = 1)\)
satisfy the invariant.
Therefore
all states in all paths from states in which \((x = 0)\) also
satisfy the invariant.
