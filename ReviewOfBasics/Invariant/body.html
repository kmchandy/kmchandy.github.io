    The state of a <i>do-od</i> loop is given by the values of its
    variables.
    The execution of a guarded command, whose guard evaluates to true,
    may change values of variables, and thus cause a transition from
    one state to another.
    There are no transitions from a state in which the guards of all
    commands are false.
    If the guards of multiple commands are true in a state \(s\) then
    there can be transitions from \(s\) to multiple different states;
    any of these transitions from \(s\) could be taken.

    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    Consider a do-od loop that sorts an array \(x[0, 1, 2,
    3]\) in increasing order by flipping adjacent out-of-order
    pairs. The loop has a guarded command for each adjacent pair of
    elements; the guard evaluates to true when the pair is out
    of order, and the command switches the pair.
    <p>
    If \(x =[10, 5, 1]\) then one of two commands can be executed:
    either flip \(x[0], x[1]\) or flip \(x[1], x[2]\).
    The state-transition graph has edges from state \(x =[10, 5, 1]\)
    to state \(x =[5, 10, 1]\) and to state \(x =[10, 1, 5]\).

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">States and Graphs</h4>
    The states and state transitions of a system are represented by a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">
    directed graph
    </a>
    in which vertices represent states and edges represent
    transitions.
    We call this graph the state-transition graph.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Computations and Paths</h4>
    A <i>computation</i> is a sequence of states where there exists a
    transition from each state in the sequence to the next state of
    the sequence.
    A computation is represented by a path through the
    state-transition graph. 
    <p>
    In this module, we treat the following as equivalent: vertex and
    state, edge and state transition, computation and path.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Stable</h4>
A predicate \(P\) on states is said to be <i>stable</i> exactly when all
transitions from states in which \(P\) holds are to states in
which \(P\) holds.
In the state-transition diagram, a set \(P\) of vertices is stable exactly
when all edges from vertices in \(P\) are to vertices in \(P\).

<p>
We prove that a predicate \(P\) is stable for a do-od loop by
showing that it is maintained by all its guarded commands:
<p>
\(
\{P\} \; g \rightarrow c \; \{P\}
\)
    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Initial Conditions and Invariants</h4>
The <i>initial condition</i> of a loop is a predicate that holds when
iterations of the loop are initiated.
An <i>invariant</i> of a loop is a stable predicate that holds
initially.

<p>
The initial condition and invariant specify an initial and invariant
set of states in the state-transition diagram.
All paths from initial states remain forever in the invariant
set of set of states.
