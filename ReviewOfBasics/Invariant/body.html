<h5 class="w3-text-teal">
This module reviews invariant and stable predicates in
nondeterministic loops.
</h5>
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Stable</h4>
<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
A predicate \(P\) on states is <i>stable</i> exactly when all
transitions from states in which \(P\) holds are to states in
which \(P\) holds.
</h5>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
In the state-transition diagram, a set \(P\) of vertices is stable exactly
when all edges from vertices in \(P\) are to vertices in \(P\).
Because there are no transitions from inside a stable set to outside the
set, there are also no paths from states inside a stable set to
states outside the set.
There may, however, be paths from outside a stable set into the set.

<p>
We prove that a predicate \(P\) is stable for a do-od loop by
showing that it is maintained by all its guarded commands:
<p>
\(
\{P\} \; g \rightarrow c \; \{P\}
\)
    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Initial Conditions and Invariants</h4>
The <i>initial condition</i> of a loop is a predicate that holds when
iterations of the loop are initiated; let's call this predicate
\(init\). An initial state of the system is <i>any</i> state for which
\(init\) holds. We assume that a computation starts in some state,
i.e. we assume that there exists at least one state in
which \(init\) holds.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
An <i>invariant</i> of a do-od loop is a stable predicate that holds
initially.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Safety Proof Obligation</h3>

  <p>
  Let  \(safe\) be a set of states where we want to prove that all
  paths that start in states in \(init\) remain in
  \(safe\).
    Our safety proof obligation is to show that every state on every path
    from every state in \(init\) is in \(safe\).
</p>

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
We prove safety
by finding a stable vertex set \(I\) such that:
</p>

<p>
\(
init \subseteq I \subseteq safe \quad
\)

<hr class="new2">

<figure>
  <img src="Invariant_Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:50%">>
  <figcaption>Fig.2 - Illustration of Invariant I</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Because \(I\) is stable, all paths from \(I\) remain within
\(I\).  Because \(init\) is a subset of \(I\), all paths from \(init\)
remain within \(I\). 
All paths from \(init\) remain within \(safe\) because \(I\)
is in \(safe\).

<p>
The initial condition and invariant specify an initial and invariant
set of states in the state-transition diagram.
All paths from initial states remain forever in the invariant
set of set of states.

    Proofs of safety for distributed and sequential algorithms are
identical.
We will review the material in this module when we discuss safety.
