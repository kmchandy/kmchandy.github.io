This module reviews invariant and stable predicates in
nondeterministic loops.
</h5>
<hr class="new2">

    The state of a <i>do-od</i> loop is given by the values of its
    variables.
    The execution of a guarded command, whose guard evaluates to true,
    may change values of variables, and thus cause a transition from
    one state to another.
    There are no transitions from a state in which the guards of all
    commands are false.
    If the guards of multiple commands are true in a state \(s\) then
    there can be transitions from \(s\) to multiple different states;
    any of these transitions from \(s\) could be taken.

    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    Consider a do-od loop that sorts an array \(x[0, 1, 2,
    3]\) in increasing order by flipping adjacent out-of-order
    pairs. The loop has a guarded command for each adjacent pair of
    elements; the guard evaluates to true when the pair is out
    of order, and the command switches the pair.
    <p>
    If \(x =[10, 5, 1]\) then one of two commands can be executed:
    either flip \(x[0], x[1]\) or flip \(x[1], x[2]\).
    The state-transition graph has edges from state \(x =[10, 5, 1]\)
    to state \(x =[5, 10, 1]\) and to state \(x =[10, 1, 5]\).

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">States and Graphs</h4>
    The states and state transitions of a system are represented by a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">
    directed graph
    </a>
    in which vertices represent states and edges represent
    transitions.
    We call this graph the state-transition graph.

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Computations and Paths</h4>
    A <i>computation</i> is a sequence of states where there exists a
    transition from each state in the sequence to the next state of
    the sequence.
    A computation is represented by a path through the
    state-transition graph. 
    <p>
    In this module, we treat the following as equivalent: vertex and
    state, edge and state transition, computation and path.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Stable</h4>
<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
A predicate \(P\) on states is <i>stable</i> exactly when all
transitions from states in which \(P\) holds are to states in
which \(P\) holds.
</h5>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
In the state-transition diagram, a set \(P\) of vertices is stable exactly
when all edges from vertices in \(P\) are to vertices in \(P\).
Because there are no transitions from inside a stable set to outside the
set, there are also no paths from states inside a stable set to
states outside the set.
There may, however, be paths from outside a stable set into the set.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
We prove that a predicate \(P\) is stable for a do-od loop by
showing that it is maintained by all its guarded commands:
<p>
\(
\{P\} \; g \rightarrow c \; \{P\}
\)
    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Initial Conditions and Invariants</h4>
The <i>initial condition</i> of a loop is a predicate that holds when
iterations of the loop are initiated; let's call this predicate
\(init\). An initial state of the system is <i>any</i> state for which
\(init\) holds. We assume that a computation starts in some state,
i.e. we assume that there exists at least one state in
which \(init\) holds.

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
An <i>invariant</i> of a do-od loop is a stable predicate that holds
initially.

  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Safety Proof Obligation</h3>

  <p>
  Let  \(safe\) be a set of states where we want to prove that all
  paths that start in states in \(init\) remain in
  \(safe\).
    Our safety proof obligation is to show that every state on every path
    from every state in \(init\) is in \(safe\).
</p>

<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
We prove safety
by finding a stable vertex set \(I\) such that:
</p>

<p>
\(
init \subseteq I \subseteq safe \quad
\)

<hr class="new2">

<figure>
  <img src="Invariant_Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:50%">>
  <figcaption>Fig.2 - Illustration of Invariant I</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Because \(I\) is stable, all paths from \(I\) remain within
\(I\).  Because \(init\) is a subset of \(I\), all paths from \(init\)
remain within \(I\). 
All paths from \(init\) remain within \(safe\) because \(I\)
is in \(safe\).

<p>
The initial condition and invariant specify an initial and invariant
set of states in the state-transition diagram.
All paths from initial states remain forever in the invariant
set of set of states.

    Proofs of safety for distributed and sequential algorithms are
identical.
We will review the material in this module when we discuss safety.
