    <!------------------------------------------------------------>
    
    This module is a review of nondeterministic iteration implemented
    as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language">
<i>do-od</i> loops.</a>

    A <i>do-od</i> loop consists of a set of guarded commands. A guarded
    command consists of a guard and a command, and we use the syntax:
    <pre>
guard -> command
</pre>
    The execution of the loop is as follows: Execute any guarded command
    of the loop for which the guard evaluates to True. Execution of the loop
    terminates when all guards evaluate to False.
    
    <p>
    A do-od loop is an example of a nondeterministic program:
    Multiple guards may be true and the command that is executed is
    chosen nondeterministically.

    <h3 style="color:red;">Example: Sorting</h3>
    Let \(X\) be an array of \(N\) numbers. The following loop sorts
    the array in ascending order.  (We assume that indices
    start at 0.)
    <pre>
for all i where 0 < i < N:
   X[i-1] > X[i]   ->    X[i-1], X[i] = X[i], X[i-1]
    </pre>
    
    The loop has \(N-1\) guarded commands. Execution of the loop
    proceeds by executing any of the \(N-1\) guarded commands for
    which the guard is true. So, execution of the loop proceeds by
    flipping any adjacent pair of elements that is out of
    order. Execution of the loop terminates when all guards are False,
    and therefore all adjacent pairs are in order.

    <h5 style="color:blue;">
    Distributed computation is modeled as
    nondeterministic iteration where at each step one agent is
    selected nondeterministically to change its state.
    This model extends the do-od loop by adding the concept of
    <a href=""><i>fairness</i></a>.
