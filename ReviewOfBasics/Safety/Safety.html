    <p class="w3-text-teal">Representing a System by a Graph</p>
  We represent the states and state transitions of a system by a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>
  in which vertices represent states and edges
    represent  transitions.
    A <i>computation</i> is a path through the graph.
    We also use the term <i>system trajectory</i> to represent a path
    through the graph, emphasizing that vertices represent states.
    In this module we treat vertex and state, edges and state
    transitions, computations and paths as equivalent.

    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Safety Proof Obligation</h3>
    Let \(init\) be the set of initial states of the system;
    the system can start in any state in \(init\).
    \(init\) is not empty.
    <p>
    Let  \(safe\) be a set of states where we want to prove that all
    computations that start in states in \(init\) remain in
    \(safe\).
    <hr class="new2">
    <p style="color:blue;">
    Our proof obligation is to show that every state on every path
    from every state in \(init\) is in \(safe\).
    </p>
    <hr class="new2">
    <p>
    For sets \(P, Q\) of states, we will use the short form, "<i>every
    path from \(P\) is in \(Q\)</i>" for "every state in every path
    from every vertex in \(P\) is in \(Q\)."


<!----------------------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Stable</h4>
<b>stable</b> is a function from sets of vertices to the Booleans.
\(stable(P)\) holds exactly when every edge from a vertex in \(P\) is
to a vertex in \(P\).
</p>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
\(
stable(P) \; \equiv \; (P \rightarrow P)
\)
</h4>



<figure>
  <img src="StablePaths.jpg" alt="Fig5" style="width:60%">>
  <figcaption>Fig.4 - Paths from a stable set remain in the set</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
There are no paths from inside a stable set to outside the set because
there are no edges from inside the set to outside the set. There may,
however, be paths from outside a stable set into the set as shown in
the diagram.
</p>

<p>
From the definition, \(stable(P)\) holds exactly when all vertices on
all paths from all vertices in \(P\) are in \(P\). 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-teal">
\(
stable(P) \; \equiv \; (P \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} P)
\)
</p>

<p style="color:red;"><b>Example of Stable</b></p>
\(
\textit{stable}(\{4, 5\})
\)
<br>
Explanation: Every outgoing edge from vertex \(4\) is to vertex \(5\)
which is in set \(\{4, 5\}\), and every 
outgoing edge from vertex \(5\) is to vertex \(4\)
which is in set \(\{4, 5\}\).
</p>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">How to Prove Safety: Invariant</h4>
<hr class="new2">
<h5 style="color:blue;">
We prove safety
by finding a stable vertex set \(I\) such that:
</p>

<p>
\(
init \subseteq I \subseteq safe \quad
\)
</h5>
<hr class="new2">

<figure>
  <img src="Invariant_Slide1.jpg" alt="Fig6" style="width:60%">>
  <figcaption>Fig.5 - Illustration of Invariant I</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Any stable vertex set \(I\) that satisfies the above equation, \(init
\subseteq I \subseteq safe\), is called an <i>invariant</i> of the
graph.  Because \(I\) is stable, all paths from \(I\) remain within
\(I\).  So all paths from \(init\) remain within \(I\).  Therefore,
all paths from \(init\) remain within \(safe\).
</p>
<p>
 We discharge our safety proof obligation by finding an
invariant. 
A system may have many invariants; all we have to do is find any one.
</p>

<!----------------------------------->
<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Definition in Terms of Predicates</h3>
The concepts defined in terms of graphs extend to definitions in terms
of
<a href="../Predicates/Predicates.html">predicates</a> on states in
the obvious way:
A predicate corresponds to the set of vertices which is the extension
of the predicate.

<p>
Next, we summarize the definitions in terms of predicates.
<p>
    \(P \rightarrow Q\) holds for a system exactly when all
    transitions from states in which \(P\) holds end in states in
    which \(Q\) holds.
    We prove \(P \rightarrow Q\) by proving 
\(
\{P\} \: a \: \{Q\})
\)
for all guarded commands \(a\) of the system.

<p class="w3-text-teal">stable</p>
\(stable(P)\) holds for a system exactly when all transitions from
states in which \(P\) holds are to states in which \(P\) holds.
<p>
\(
stable(P) \; \equiv \; (P \rightarrow P)
\)

<!----------------------------------->
<h3  class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
This module presents all the concepts used to prove safety in this
course. 
We showed how state-transition systems are represented as directed
graphs. We showed how safety can be defined in terms of 
paths in graphs. We defined the concepts <i>stable</i> and
<i>invariant</i> in terms of edges and paths in graphs, and we showed
how these concepts are used to prove safety.
