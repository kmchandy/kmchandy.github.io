    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Hoare Triples</h1>
    This is a <i>very short, limited review</i> of properties of Hoare
    triples that you probably studied in earlier courses.

    
    <hr class="new2">
    <h5 style="color:blue;">
    A <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare triple</a>
    has the form \(\{P\} c \{Q\}\) where \(P\) and \(Q\) are predicates on
    states of a system and \(c\) is a command. The meaning of the
    triple is that if \(P\) holds when the command \(c\) is initiated
    then execution of the command terminates and \(Q\) holds upon
    termination.
    </h5>
    <hr class="new2">

    \(P\) is called the precondition and \(Q\) the
    postcondition of the triple

    <p>
    (Note: We assume total rather than partial correctness.)
    </p>
  
  <h4 style="color:red;">Examples</h4>
  Examples of Hoare triples for the assignment statement \(x := x+1\)
  are: 
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \; x := x+1 \; \{x > 0\}
  \) 
  </p>
    <p>
    And a set of Hoare triples:
    </p>
    <p>
    \(
    \forall k: \quad \{x = k\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = k+1\}
     \)
 </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variables not in the Hoare Triple</h4>
    Variables that are not mentioned in a Hoare triple are assumed,
    implicitly, to remain unchanged by the command. For example, if a
    program has variables \(x\) and \(y\), then the triple:
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
    </p>
    is implicitly equivalent to:
    <p>
  \(
  \forall k: \quad \{(x = 0) \wedge (y=k) \} \;  x := x+1 \; \{(x = 1)
    \wedge (y = k)\}
  \)

    <h3 style="color:red;">Examples</h3>
    Consider the following Hoare triples.

    <ol>
      <li>
\(
\{x < 0\} \; c \; \{(x = 1) \vee (x = 2)\}
\)
</li>
<li>
\(
\{x > 0\} \; c \; \{(x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\}
\)
</li>
<li>
\(
\{x > 1\} \; c \; \{x < 0\}
\)
</li>
</ol>



What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = -1\) by a command \(c\) that
    satisfies <i>all</i> the above three Hoare triples?
</p>

<p>Since the state satisfies the
    first precondition, \(x < 0\), the state after the transition must
    satisfy the first postcondition, \((x = 1) \vee (x = 2)\). The
    other two Hoare triples don't address the precondition \(x =
-1\), and so the postconditions of these Hoare triples are irrelevant
    for this question. Therefore, the transitions from \(x = -1\) are to 
states \(x = 1\) or \(x = 2\).

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = 2\) that satisfy all of the
    above Hoare triples?
</p>

<p>
The first Hoare triple doesn't address the precondition \(x = 2\).
<p>
The precondition \(x > 0\) of the second triple holds when \(x = 2\)
and therefore its postcondition, \((x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\), must hold in the
next state.
<p>
The precondition \(x > 1\) of the third triple holds when \(x = 2\)
and therefore its postcondition, \(x < 0\), must hold in the
next state.
<p>
Both postconditions, \((x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\) and \(x <
0\) must hold in the next state. So the only transition from \(x = 2\)
is to state \(x = -1\).


<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
<p>
    What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = 0\)?
</p>

<p>
None of the three preconditions hold when \(x = 0\), and therefore the
next state can be <i>any</i> state. 


<p style="color:red;">Example: Unimplementable Commands</p>
What transitions satisfy all the following Hoare triples?
<p>
\(
\{x = 0\} \; c \; \{x > 0\}, \quad \{x = 0\} \; c \; \{x < 0\}
\)
</p>
<p>
This command cannot be initiated in a state in which \(x = 0\) because
both postconditions \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\) must hold when the command
terminates.

<p>
In this course we will ensure that the commands specified in our
algorithms can be executed in every state.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Weakest Precondition for Assignment</h3>
What is the largest set of states in which execution of the assignment
<pre>
x = x + 1
</pre>
results in a state in which <code>x > 1</code>?
<p>
This question is equivalent to: What is the <i>weakest</i> preconditon
\(P\) that satisfies the Hoare triple \(\{P\} x := x + 1 \{x > 1\}\)?
<p>
The answer is obtained by substituting the right-hand side (i.e. 
\(x+1\)) of the assignment for the left-hand side (i.e., \(x\)) of the
assignment in the postcondition
(i.e., \(\{x > 1\}\)).
<p>
With this substitution we get:
<p>
\(
x + 1 > 1
\)
<p>
Which simplifies to \(x > 0\). Therefore we get the Hoare triple:
<p>
\(
\{x > 0\} x := x + 1 \{x > 1\}
\)
<p>
<i>Any precondition that is stronger than the weakest
precondition satisfies the Hoare triple.</i>
<p>
In terms of sets of
states, any subset of the largest set (i.e., extension of \(x > 0\))
also satisfies the Hoare triple. For example:
<p>
\(
[(x = 5) \Rightarrow (x > 0)]
\)
<p>
and therefore \(\{x = 5\} x := x + 1 \{x > 1\}\).


<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
What is the weakest precondition \(P\) that satisfies the following
Hoare triple?
<p>
\(
\{P\} x := 2*x + 3*y \{5*x + y > 25\}
\)
<p>
Substitute \(2*x+3*y\) for \(x\) in \(5*x + y > 25\) to get:
<p>
\(
5*(2*x + 3*y) + y > 25
\), or
<p>
\(
10*x + 16*y > 25
\)
<p>
So, we have the Hoare triple:
\(
\{10*x +16*y > 25\}  x := 2*x + 3*y \{5*x + y > 25\}
\)
<p>
<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
Is the following Hoare triple correct?
<p>
\(
\{(x = 1) \wedge (y =1)\} x := 2*x + 3*y \{5*x + y > 25\}
\)
<p>
Yes, because \((x = 1) \wedge (y =1)\) is stronger than
\(10*x +16*y > 25\), i.e.,
<p>
\(
[(x = 1) \wedge (y =1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad (10*x +16*y >25)]
\)
<p>
You can also verify the state transition directly. If the above assignment is executed
in a state in which \((x = 1) \wedge (y =1)\) then in the next state
\((x = 5) \wedge (y =1)\) which satisfies the postcondition.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
We describe algorithms in terms of state transitions and predicates
that hold at points in a computation.
We use Hoare triples to relate commands defined in terms of states to
commands implemented in a programming language.
