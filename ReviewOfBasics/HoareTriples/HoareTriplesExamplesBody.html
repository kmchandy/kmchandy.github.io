<h2 style="color:red;">Examples</h2>
Consider the following Hoare triples.

    <ol>
      <li>
\(
\{x < 0\} \; c \; \{(x = 1) \vee (x = 2)\}
\)
</li>
<li>
\(
\{x > 0\} \; c \; \{(x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\}
\)
</li>
<li>
\(
\{x > 1\} \; c \; \{x < 0\}
\)
</li>
</ol>



What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = -1\) by a command \(c\) that
    satisfies <i>all</i> the above three Hoare triples?
</p>

<p>Since the state satisfies the
    first precondition, \(x < 0\), the state after the transition must
    satisfy the first postcondition, \((x = 1) \vee (x = 2)\). The
    other two Hoare triples don't address the precondition \(x =
-1\), and so the postconditions of these Hoare triples are irrelevant
    for this question. Therefore, the transitions from \(x = -1\) are to 
states \(x = 1\) or \(x = 2\).

<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = 2\) that satisfy all of the
    above Hoare triples?
</p>

<p>
The first Hoare triple doesn't address the precondition \(x = 2\).
<p>
The precondition \(x > 0\) of the second triple holds when \(x = 2\)
and therefore its postcondition, \((x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\), must hold in the
next state.
<p>
The precondition \(x > 1\) of the third triple holds when \(x = 2\)
and therefore its postcondition, \(x < 0\), must hold in the
next state.
<p>
Both postconditions, \((x = 0) \vee (x = -1)\) and \(x <
0\) must hold in the next state. So the only transition from \(x = 2\)
is to state \(x = -1\).


<p style="color:red;">Example</p>
<p>
    What transitions
are possible from a state in which \(x = 0\)?
</p>

<p>
None of the three preconditions hold when \(x = 0\), and therefore the
next state can be <i>any</i> state. 


<p style="color:red;">Example: Unimplementable Commands</p>
What transitions satisfy all the following Hoare triples?
<p>
\(
\{x = 0\} \; c \; \{x > 0\}, \quad \{x = 0\} \; c \; \{x < 0\}
\)
</p>
<p>
This command cannot be initiated in a state in which \(x = 0\) because
both postconditions \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\) must hold when the command
terminates.

<p>
In this course we will ensure that the commands specified in our
algorithms can be executed in every state.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
We may specify a command by sets of pre- and post-conditions that the
command must specify.
There may be many commands that satisfy these conditions, and we can
use any command that satisfies these conditions in an
implementation. Specifying commands in this way allows us to describe
algorithms in terms of predicates rather than by using statements in a
specific programming language.
