    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Hoare Triples</h1>
    This is a very short, very limited, review of Hoare
    triples that you studied in earlier courses.

    
    <hr class="new2">
    <p style="color:blue;">
    A <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare triple</a>
    has the form \(\{P\} c \{Q\}\) where \(P\) and \(Q\) are predicates on
    states of a system and \(c\) is a command. The meaning of the
    triple is that if \(P\) holds when the command \(c\) is initiated
    then execution of the command terminates and \(Q\) holds upon
    termination.
    </p>
    </h5>
    <hr class="new2">

    \(P\) is called the precondition and \(Q\) the
    postcondition of the triple

    <p>
    (We assume total rather than partial correctness.)
    </p>
  
  <h4 style="color:red;">Examples</h4>
  Examples of Hoare triples for the assignment statement \(x := x+1\)
  are: 
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \; x := x+1 \; \{x > 0\}
  \) 
  </p>
    <p>
    And a set of Hoare triples:
    </p>
    <p>
    \(
    \forall k: \quad \{x = k\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = k+1\}
     \)
 </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variables not in the Hoare Triple</h4>
    Variables that are not mentioned in a Hoare triple are assumed,
    implicitly, to remain unchanged by the command. For example, if a
    program has variables \(x\) and \(y\), then the triple:
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
    </p>
    is implicitly equivalent to:
    <p>
  \(
  \forall k: \quad \{(x = 0) \wedge (y=k) \} \;  x := x+1 \; \{(x = 1)
    \wedge (y = k)\}
  \)
