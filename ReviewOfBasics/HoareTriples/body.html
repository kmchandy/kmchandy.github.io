    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Hoare Triples</h1>
    This module is a review of Hoare triples.

    A <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare triple</a>
    has the form \(\{P\} c \{Q\}\) where \(P\) and \(Q\) are predicates on
    states of a system and \(c\) is a command. The meaning of the
    triple is that if \(P\) holds when the command \(c\) is initiated
    then execution of the command terminates and \(Q\) holds upon
    termination.
    </p>
    </h5>
    <hr class="new2">

    \(P\) is called the precondition and \(Q\) the
    postcondition of the triple

We assume
<a

total
</a>
rather than partial correctness.
</p>
  
  <h4 style="color:red;">Examples</h4>
  Examples of Hoare triples for the assignment statement \(x := x+1\)
  are: 
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
  </p>
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \; x := x+1 \; \{x > 0\}
  \) 
  </p>
    and:
    </p>
    <p>
    \(
    \forall k: \quad \{x = k\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = k+1\}
     \)
 </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variables not in the Hoare Triple</h4>
    Variables that are not mentioned in a Hoare triple are assumed,
    implicitly, to remain unchanged by the command. For example, if a
    program has variables \(x\) and \(y\), then the triple:
  <p>
  \(
  \{x = 0\} \;  x := x+1 \; \{x = 1\}
  \)
    </p>
    is implicitly equivalent to:
    <p>
  \(
  \forall k: \quad \{(x = 0) \wedge (y=k) \} \;  x := x+1 \; \{(x = 1)
    \wedge (y = k)\}
\)

<p>

While designing a program we may specify a command in terms of its
pre- and post-conditions and later implement the command in a
programming language.
