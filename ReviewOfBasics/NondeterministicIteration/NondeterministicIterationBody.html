This module reviews <i>nondeterminism</i>
in the form of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language">
<i>do-od</i> loops.</a>

    A <i>do-od</i> loop consists of a set of <b>guarded commands</b>. A guarded
    command consists of a <b>guard</b> and a <b>command</b> with the syntax:
    <pre>
guard -> command
</pre>
    The execution of the do-od loop is as follows: Execute <i>any</i> guarded command
    of the loop for which the guard evaluates to True. Execution of the loop
    terminates when all guards evaluate to False.
    
<p>
Most programming languages are deterministic: the next
statement to be executed is uniquely determined by the current state
of the program.

By contrast, a do-od loop is nondeterministic: Multiple guards may be true and the
next statement to be executed can be <i>any</i> guarded command with a true
guard.

Different executions of the same do-od loop may execute commands in
different orders.

    <h3 style="color:red;">Example: Sorting</h3>
    Let \(X\) be an array of \(N\) numbers. The following loop sorts
    the array in ascending order.  (We assume that indices
    start at 0.)
    <pre>
for all i where 0 < i < N:
   X[i-1] > X[i]   ->    X[i-1], X[i] = X[i], X[i-1]
    </pre>
    
The loop has \(N-1\) guarded commands, where the <i>i</i>-th command
is:
<pre>
X[i-1] > X[i]   ->    X[i-1], X[i] = X[i], X[i-1]
</pre>
Execution of the loop proceeds by 
    flipping <i>any</i> adjacent pair of elements that is out of
    order. Execution terminates when every adjacent pair is in order.
