This module reviews <i>nondeterminism</i>
in the form of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language">
<i>do-od</i> loops</a>.
The module describes states, transitions, and their graph
representations.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">do-od loops</h4>
    A <i>do-od</i> loop consists of a set of <b>guarded commands</b>. A guarded
    command consists of a <b>guard</b> and a <b>command</b> with the syntax:
    <pre>
guard -> command
</pre>
    The execution of the do-od loop is as follows: Execute <i>any</i> guarded command
    of the loop for which the guard evaluates to True. Execution of the loop
    terminates when all guards evaluate to False.
    
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Nondeterministic Executions</h4>
Most programming languages are <i>deterministic</i>; in a deterministic language the next
statement to be executed is uniquely determined by the current state
of the program.

By contrast, a do-od loop is <i>nondeterministic</i> --- the
next statement to be executed can be <i>any</i> guarded command with a true
guard. So,
different executions of the same do-od loop may execute commands in
different orders and result in different outputs.

    <h3 style="color:red;">Example: Sorting</h3>
    Let \(X\) be an array of \(N\) numbers. The following loop sorts
    the array in ascending order.  (We assume that indices
    start at 0.)
    <pre>
for all i where 0 < i < N:
   X[i-1] > X[i]   ->    X[i-1], X[i] = X[i], X[i-1]
    </pre>
    
The loop has \(N-1\) guarded commands, where the <i>i</i>-th command
is:
<pre>
X[i-1] > X[i]   ->    X[i-1], X[i] = X[i], X[i-1]
</pre>
Execution of the loop proceeds by 
    flipping <i>any</i> adjacent pair of elements that is out of
    order. Execution terminates when every adjacent pair is in order.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">States and Transitions in do-od Loops</h4>
    The state of a <i>do-od</i> loop is given by the values of its
    variables.
    The execution of a guarded command, whose guard evaluates to true,
    may change values of variables, and thus cause a transition from
    one state to another.
    There are no transitions from a state in which the guards of all
    commands are false.
    If the guards of multiple commands are true in a state \(s\) then
    there can be transitions from \(s\) to multiple different states;
    any of these transitions from \(s\) could be taken.

    <p style="color:red;">Example</p>
    Consider a do-od loop that sorts an array \(x[0, 1, 2,
    3]\) in increasing order by flipping adjacent out-of-order
    pairs. The loop has a guarded command for each adjacent pair of
    elements; the guard evaluates to true when the pair is out
    of order, and the command switches the pair.
    <p>
    If \(x =[10, 5, 1]\) then one of two commands can be executed:
    either flip \(x[0], x[1]\) or flip \(x[1], x[2]\).
    The state-transition graph has edges from state \(x =[10, 5, 1]\)
    to state \(x =[5, 10, 1]\) and to state \(x =[10, 1, 5]\).

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Graph Representation of States and Transitions</h4>
    The states and state transitions of a system are represented by a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">
    directed graph
    </a>
    in which vertices represent states and edges represent
    transitions.
    We call this graph the state-transition graph.

<p>
    A <i>computation</i> is a sequence of states where there exists a
    transition from each state in the sequence to the next state of
    the sequence.
    A computation is represented by a path through the
    state-transition graph. 
    <p>
    In this chapter, we treat the following as equivalent: vertex and
state, edge and state transition, computation and path.
