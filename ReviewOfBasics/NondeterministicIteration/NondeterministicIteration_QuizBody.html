    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Question</h3>
    If the <i>do-od</i> loop, below, solves a problem then does the
<i>while</i> loop, below, also solve the same problem? Why?

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">do-od loop</h4>
<pre>
do
   g0 -> c0
   g1 -> c1
od
</pre>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">while loop</h4>
<pre>
while (g0 OR g1):
   if g0 then c0
   if g1 then c1
</pre>
or in Python notation:
<pre>
while (g0 OR g1):
   if g0: c0
   if g1: c1
</pre>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
Yes, the while loop also solves the problem. Let the
statements in the while loop be s0 and s1. The sequence of
statements executed in the while loop are
<p>
s0; s1; s0; s1; s0; s1; ....
</p>
until not(g0 or g1).
<p>
In this sequence, drop the statements for which the <i>if</i> clause
is False; the resulting sequence is a possible sequence of statement
executions for the do-od loop. Since all possible statement executions
of the do-od loop solves the problem, the while loop also solve the
problem.

Does the following loop always, sometimes, or never terminate? Explain.
<p>
<pre>
x = 2
do
   x >= 1   ->  x = x - 1
   x == 1   ->  x = x + 1
od
</pre>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Answer</h3>
The loop terminates for some, but not all, executions.
<p>
Let the statements in the loop be s0 and s1, in order. Here is a
sequence that does not terminate: repeat s0;s1 forever.
<p>
{x = 2} s0 {x = 1} s1 {x = 2} s0 {x = 1} s1 {x = 2}..
</p>
<p>
And here is a sequence that does terminate: s0; s0
<p>
{x = 2} s0 {x = 1} s0 {x = -1}
</p>
