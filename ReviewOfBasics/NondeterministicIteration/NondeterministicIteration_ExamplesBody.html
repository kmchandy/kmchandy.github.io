    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Shortest Path from a Source</h3>
    
    We are given a matrix \(W\) of numbers which represents a directed
    graph where \(W[i,j]\) is the weight of the edge
    \((i,j)\). If edge \((i, j)\) does not exist then \(W[i,j]\) is a
    suitably large value \(inf\). Edge weights may be negative. There are no
    cycles of negative length in 
    the graph. The problem is to find the shortest path from vertex
    \(0\) to all the other vertices.

    Let \(d\) be an array where \(d[i]\) becomes the weight of the
    shortest-weight path to \(i\).

    Initially:
    <p>
    \(
    d[0] = 0
    \)
    <br>
    For \(i \neq 0\): \(d[i] = inf\)

    <p class="w3-text-teal">Iteration</p>
    For all \(i, j\):
    <p>
    \(
    d[j] > d[i] + W[i,j] \quad \rightarrow \quad d[j] = d[i] + W[i,j]
    \)
