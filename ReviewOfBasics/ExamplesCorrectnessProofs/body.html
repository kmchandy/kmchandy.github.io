<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Examples of Correctness Proofs</h2>
This module is a very brief review of proofs of correctness of
nondeterministic iterations by using invariants and loop variants
(also called variant functions).

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Invariants</h4>
An <i>invariant</i> of a do-od loop is a predicate that holds initially and
after every iteration of the loop. We prove that a predicate \(I\) is an
invariant of a loop by showing that:
<ol>
  <li>
  \(I\) holds initially, and
  </li>
  <li>
  if \(I\) holds before the execution of any guarded command of the
  loop then \(I\) continues to hold when the command terminates, i.e.,
  we prove the following Hoare triple for every guarded command \(g
  \rightarrow c\) of the loop. 
<p>
  \(\{I\} \; g \rightarrow c \; \{I\}\)
  </li>
</ol>
If a loop terminates then \(I\) holds upon termination and all
guards evaluate to false.


<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Variant Functions</h4>
We prove that loops terminate by using loop variants, also
called variant functions.
<i>A variant function</i> is a function
from states of a system to a well-founded set.

    A
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation">
    well-founded set</a>
    is a set on which we can carry out proofs by
    induction. In this course we generally use well-founded sets that are
    integers or vectors of integers that are bounded below.

<p>
We prove that execution of a loop terminates by proving that the
execution of any command whose guard evaluates to true reduces the
value of a variant function \(f\).
Since \(f\) is bounded below it cannot decrease forever.
Therefore the computation terminates, and when it does
all guards evaluate to false.

<p>
Let \(I\) be an invariant of a loop.
Then \(I \wedge g\) holds prior to execution of any guarded command
\(g \rightarrow c\) because guard \(g\) is true.
We prove that the execution of any command with
a true guard reduces the variant function by proving the
following Hoare triple for each guarded command \(g \rightarrow c\).
<p>
\(\forall k: \quad
\{(f = k) \wedge I \wedge g\} \; c \; \{f < k\}
\)

proofs of nondeterministic iterations.
