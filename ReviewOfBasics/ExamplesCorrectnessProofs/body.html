    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Self Tests: Examples of Correctness Proofs</h2>
    This section consists of self tests of correctness proofs.
    You can use these tests to check your knowledge of
    nondeterministic iteration and: 
    <ol>
      <li>
      Invariants
      </li>
      <li>
      Variant functions
      </li>
      <li>
      Predicate that holds upon termination
      </li>
    </ol>

    The self tests cover the following problems:
    <ol>
      <li>
      <a href="Sorting/Sorting.html">
      Sorting
      </a>
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="ShortestPath/ShortestPath.html">
      Shortest paths in a graph
      </a>
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="AverageOfSensors/AverageOfSensors.html">
      Distributed averaging

      <a href="FlightFormation/FlightFormation.html">

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h5 style="color:blue;">
    You will see that proofs of correctness of distributed and
    sequential algorithms are much the same.
    Concepts in sequential algorithms also appear in reasoning about
    distributed systems with continuous states that evolve over
    continuous time.
