    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Self Test: All-points Shortest Paths</h1>

    <p>
    An edge-weight matrix \(W\) represents a graph \(G\) in which the
    weight of edge \(i, j\) is \(W[i,j]\).
    For all \(j\), \(W[j, j] = 0\).
    The graph has no cycles of negative length.
    Let \(sp(W)\) be a matrix of the same dimensions
    as \(W\) and whose \((i, j)\)-th element is the length of the
    shortest path from vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\).

    <p>
    Prove that the following loop terminates and that
    at termination \(D = sp(W)\).


    <pre>
D = W
for all i, j, k:
  D[i,j] + D[j, k] < D[i,k]  ->   D[i,k] = D[i,j] + D[j, k]
    </pre>

    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 1</h5>
    An invariant of the program is:
    <p>
    \(D \leq W\)
    and
    <br>
    for all \(i, j\): \(D[i,j]\) is the length of a path from
    \(i\) to \(j\).
    
    <p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
    The predicate holds initially because \(D = W\). The proof that
    the execution of every command maintains the predicate is
    straightforward. 

    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 2</h5>
    \(D\) itself is a variant function. The proof is as follows.

    <p>
    For each \(i, j\), there
    exist only a bounded number of values for \(D[i,j]\) that satisfy
    the invariant. This is because there are only a bounded number of
    cycle-free paths from \(i\) to \(j\). \(D\) is bounded below by
    the matrix of shortest-path lengths.
    Therefore \(D\) can decrease only a finite number of times before
    the lower bound is reached.
    <p>
    The execution of any command with a True
    guard reduces \(D\). The proof is straightforward.


<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Answer 3</h5>
Next we prove that if the invariant holds and all the
    guards are false then \(D = sp(W)\) where \(sp(W)\) is the matrix
    of lengths of shortest paths.

<p>
We prove the result by induction on \(m\), the number of hops in
shortest paths between vertices.  The result holds for shortest paths
consisting of a single hop, i.e. if the shortest path from \(i\) to
\(j\) is along edge \(i, j\) then:
<p>
\(
D[i, j] = sp(W)[i, j]
\).
<p>
Assume that the result holds for all shortest paths with \(m\) hops
and prove that it
holds for shortest paths with \(m+1\) hops. Let the shortest path from
\(i\) to \(k\) take \(m+1\) hops. Let \(j\) be the prefinal vertex on
this shortest path. Then
<p>
\(
sp(W)[i,k] = sp(W)[i,j] + sp(W)[j, k]
\)
The result follows from the induction assumption.
