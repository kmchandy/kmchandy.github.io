    <h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    A system has two agents \(x\) and \(y\) with a channel in each
    direction between them. The system has two tokens in the initial
    state. If an agent has a token then it sends it to the other
    agent.
    <p>
    The figure below illustrates how a token may move between the
  agents. The figure has three diagrams. A token is shown as a red
    disc.
    In all three diagrams, one token is at agent \(x\). In the top
  diagram, one token is on the channel to agent \(y\); in the middle
    diagram, one token is at \(y\); and in the lower diagram,
    one token is on the channel to agent \(x\).

    </figure>
    <p>
    Using our definition of knowledge, when \(x\) is in a
    state in which \(x\) holds exactly one token, \(x\) knows that
    \(y\) does not hold both tokens.
    
    <p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
    In the above system, let \(P\) be the predicate:
    "\(y\) holds exactly one token."
    <p>
    The predicate, "\(x\) knows \(P\)" is universally False. There is
    no state in which \(x\) knows that \(y\) holds exactly one token because
    tokens may be in channels.
