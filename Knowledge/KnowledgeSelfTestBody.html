    Let \(P\) be a predicate on the states of an agent \(y\), and let \(x\)
    be a different agent in the system. Let \(T\) and \(T'\) be points on a
    timeline with \(T < T'\).

    True or False? If \(\neg(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P)\) holds at \(T\)

    have received a message between \(T\) and \(T'\).

    True or False? If \(\neg(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P)\) holds at \(T\)
    and \(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P\) holds at \(T'\) then \(x\) must
    have sent a message between \(T\) and \(T'\).

    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Answers</h1>

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Problem 1</h2>
    True.
    <p>Follows from definition of
    \(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P\).

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Problem 2</h2>
    \(P\) must hold at all points between point \(V\)
    and \(T\) but not necessarily before \(V\).
    <p>
    Follows directly from the theorem on communication to learn about
    change.
    
    <p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
    Consider this example: The system has a single indivisible token.
    \(P\) is the predicate: "Agent \(B\) does not hold a token."
    Agent \(B\) holds the token before point \(V\) and sends the token
    to \(A\) at \(V\). Agent \(A\) knows \(P\) when it receives the
    token. But \(P\) does not hold before \(V\).
<p  style="color:red;">Anthropomorphic Argument</p>
Proofs in which we assume digital agents have human capabilities can
be faulty. They give insight, but it's best to use definitions.
    <p>
     Agent \(A\) gets no message with information after the
    message sent by \(B\) at point \(V\). So, agent \(A\) does not
    learn anything after that point. If there is a transition from
    \(\neg P\) to \(P\) after point \(V\) then there is no way for
\(A\) to find out about this transition.
<p>

    

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Problem 3</h2>
\(P\) must hold between \(T\) and point \(4\) on \(B\)'s timeline.
    <p>
Follows directly from the theorem knowledge implies control.
<p  style="color:red;">Anthropomorphic Argument</p>
Proofs in which we assume digital agents have human capabilities can
be faulty. They give insight, but it's best to use definitions.
<p>
Agent \(B\) can change \(P\) only after getting permission
from agent \(A\). This permission may be communicated through
intermediate agents. The earliest point that \(B\) gets a message is
at point \(4\).


    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Problem 4</h2>
<p class="w3-text-teal">Part a</p>
True.
<p>
Because \(\neg(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P)\) holds at \(T\) there is
some state of the system where \(\neg P\) holds for the local state
\(s\) of
agent \(y\) while the state of agent \(x\) is its state at point \(T\).
<p>
Because \(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P\) holds at \(T'\) the state of
\(y\) cannot be \(s\) at point \(T'\). So there is a transition from
\(s\) to a different state \(s'\) at some point between \(T\) and
\(T'\). If \(x\) doesn't get a message after \(y\) transits from 
\(s\) to \(s'\), then the cut through point \(T'\) on \(x\)'s timeline and point
\(T\) on \(y\)'s timeline is a consistent cut. So, 
\(\neg(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P)\) holds at \(T'\) as well.

<p class="w3-text-teal">Part b</p>
False.
<p>
Example. \(P\) is the predicate "\(y\) does not hold a token." And
\(x\) gets a token from \(y\) between points \(T\) and \(T'\). So,
\(\neg(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P)\) holds at \(T\) and
\(x \; \textrm{knows} \; P\) at \(T'\), and \(x\) sends no messages.
