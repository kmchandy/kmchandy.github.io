    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What Agents Know</h1>

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">
This module gives a formal definition for the frequently used informal
phrase: "An agent <i>knows</i> something about other agents and and
channels." 
</h4>


    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Key Ideas</h1>
    We sometimes use anthropmorphic arguments in reasoning about
    systems --- we invest digital
    agents with human characteristics. For example, a programmer may
    say "an agent <i>knows</i> that another agent is idle." Endowing software with
    human capabilities can be dangerous when terms are ambiguous.
    <p>
    In this module we define a predicate "agent \(x\)
    knows \(P\)" where \(P\) is a predicate on states of a system.
    In later modules, we will use this definition to discuss
    algorithms.

    <p>
    This module presents several theorems. The proofs follow in a
    straightforward way from the definition of
    <a href="../ChannelSnapshots/ChannelSnapshots.html">consistent
    cuts </a>.

    <h2 class="w3-text-teal">What an Agent Knows</h2>
    Let \(x\) be an agent, \(P\) a predicate on system states, and
    \(Q\) a predicate on states of \(x\).
    <p>
    \(P\) is a <i>global predicate</i> because it is a predicate on
    states of the entire system. \(Q\) is a <i>local
    predicate</i> of \(x\) because it is a predicate only on the states of
    agent \(x\) and is independent of the states of channels and the
    states of other agents.

    <p>
    We
    define the predicate "\(x\) <i>knows</i> \(P\)" as follows.
    <hr class="new2">
    <h5 style="color:blue;">
    <p>
    \(x\) knows \(P\) is the weakest predicate \(Q\) on the states of
    \(x\) such that:
    
    <p>
    \(
    [init \; \Rightarrow \; always([Q \;
    \Rightarrow \; P])]
    \)
    <p>
    </h5>
    <hr class="new2">
    <p>
    If the system is in a state where \(x\) knows \(P\) then we can
    deduce that
    the entire system satisfies a global predicate
    \(P\) merely from the local state of agent \(x\).

    <h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    A system consisting of agents \(0, \ldots,  N\) has two indivisible
    tokens which are not created or destroyed. Let \(P\) be the
    predicate: "all channels and agents \(1, \ldots, N\) have
no tokens." 

<p>
"Agent \(0\) knows P" is a predicate on the states of agent
\(0\). This predicate holds in those states of agent \(0\) which
guarantee that \(P\) holds.

<p>
"Agent \(0\) knows P" holds exactly when agent \(0\)
holds both tokens. We can deduce properties of all channels and all
agents solely from the state of agent \(0\).

<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
Let \(P\) be the predicate: "all channels and agents \(1, \ldots, N\)
collectively hold exactly one token." 
"Agent \(0\) knows P" holds exactly when agent \(0\)
holds one token.

<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
This example deals with a system consisting of two agents \(x\) and
\(y\) and channels in both directions between the agents. The system
has a single indivisible token that is not created or destroyed. Let
\(P\) be the predicate: "\(y\) does <i>not</i> hold the token."
Agent \(x\) knows \(P\) when \(x\) holds the token. 
<p>
\(\neg\) (\(x\) knows \(P\)) is a predicate too. In this
example, this predicate
holds when \(x\) does not hold the token.

<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
Let \(P\) be the predicate: "\(y\) holds the token."
Agent \(x\) knows \(P\) is universally False because this predicate holds in no
state. Why is that?
<p>
It's because the token could be in a channel; so, we can only deduce
that the token is in a channel or at \(y\). We cannot deduce from the
state of agent \(x\) that \(y\) holds the token.
Agent \(x\) can never know that \(y\) holds the token.
<p>
Note, however, that \(x\) knows that \(y\) does <i>not</i> hold the
token when \(x\) holds the token. Agent \(x\)'s knowledge of the
predicates "\(y\) holds the token" and "\(y\) does <i>not</i> hold the
token" are not symmetric.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Notation</h5>
    "\(x\) knows \(P\) at a point \(T\)" in a timeline means that at
    point \(T\) agent \(x\) is in a state where the predicate "\(x\)
knows \(P\)" holds.

<p>
"\(x\) knows \(P\) when \(x\) is in state \(s\)" means that the
predicate "\(x\) knows \(P\)" holds in \(s\).


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Knowledge and Consistent Cuts</h3>
Let \(P\) be a predicate on the states of a system.
<p>
<i style="color:blue;">
If  \(x\) knows \(P\) at a point \(T\) in \(x\)'s timeline
then \(P\) holds in every consistent cut through that point.</i>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The states corresponding to all consistent cuts that pass through the same
point on \(x\)'s timeline have the same common value for \(x\)'s local
state.

    <h3  style="color:red;">Example</h3>
    
<figure>
    <img src="KnowledgeDiagrams/Slide02.jpg" alt="Fig2" style="width:60%">>
    <figcaption>Fig. 2. Agent A knows P in all consistent cuts that cross
    point T</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The top figure in both diagrams above show a time T at which agent A knows
that P holds. This implies that P holds in all consistent cuts through
point T. The lower figures in the diagrams show consistent cuts which
passes point T on A's timeline; the theorem says that P holds for the
state at these cuts too. 

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: A Silent Agent retains Knowledge</h3>
Let \(x\) be an agent in a system, and let \(P\) be a
predicate on a subsystem that does not include \(x\).
Let \(T\) and \(T'\) be points on \(x\)'s timeline with \(T < T'\). If
\(x\) knows \(P\) at point \(T\) and \(x\) sends no messages in the
interval \([T, T']\) then \(x\) knows \(P\) at \(T'\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
Let \(c'\) be any consistent cut through point \(T'\) on \(x\)'s
timeline. We will prove that \(P\) holds for the state at cut \(c'\).

<p>
Let \(c\) be the
cut that is identical to \(c'\) except that it passes through point \(T\) on
\(x\)'s timeline. \(c\) is consistent because there are no
outgoing edges from \(x\)'s timeline between cuts \(c\) and
\(c'\).

<p>
Because \(x\) knows \(P\) at \(T\), \(P\) holds at \(c\). Since \(c\) and \(c'\)
are identical except for the intersection with \(x\)'s timeline,
it follows that \(P\) holds \(c'\).

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Consequence of the Theorem</h5>
An agent doesn't lose knowledge by getting information from other
agents.
<p>
An agent can only lose knowledge by sending information to
other agents. This seems counterintuitive; we'll look at the reasoning
underlying this in a later theorem.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Agents who don't listen remain Ignorant</h3>
Let \(x\) be an agent in a system, and let \(P\) be a
predicate on a subsystem that does not include \(x\).
Let \(T\) and \(T'\) be points on \(x\)'s timeline with \(T < T'\). If
\(x\) knows \(P\) at point \(T'\) and \(x\) received no messages in the
interval \([T, T']\) then \(x\) knows \(P\) at \(T\).

<p>The proof has exactly the same structure as the proof of the
previous theorem.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Consequence of the Theorem</h5>

\(x\) didn't learn anything in the interval  \([T, T']\); everything
\(x\) knows at the later point \(T'\) is knowledge it already had at
the earlier point \(T\).

<p>The only way for an agent to gain knowledge is
to receive messages. An agent cannot learn about other agents by only
sending messages or making internal state transitions.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Knowledge implies Control</h3>
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be agents in a system, and let \(P\) be a
predicate on the states of \(y\).
Let \(T\) and \(T'\) be instants in a trajectory with \(T < T'\). If
\(x\) knows \(P\) at  \(T\), and \(\neg P\) holds at \(T'\), then there
is a path in the timeline diagram from point \(T\) on \(x\)'s timeline
to point \(T'\) on \(y\)'s timeline.

<p>Proof: If there is no path from point \(T\) on \(x\)'s timeline
to point \(T'\) on \(y\)'s timeline then there exists a consistent cut
which crosses \(x\)'s timeline at \(T\) and
crosses \(y\)'s timeline at \(T'\).

<h5  style="color:red;">Example</h5>
In the figure below, agent \(A\) at point \(T\) knows that agent \(C\)
holds no tokens. At a later point \(T'\) agent \(C\) holds a
token. What must happen between points \(T\) and \(T'\)?

</figcaption>
</figure>

There must be a path in the timeline diagram from point \(T\) on agent
\(A\)'s timeline to point \(T'\) on agent \(C\)'s timeline. This path
is represented by edges that show time elapsing on a timeline and
message edges between timelines.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Consequence of the Theorem</h5>
Suppose you and your friend communicate only by means of messages
that are delayed by arbitrary (finite) amounts. Consider a situation
where your friend knows
that you are in the library at 9 pm. Then, from our definition of
knowledge, because agents only know truth, you must be in the library
at 9 pm. Moreover, you can't leave the library until
you receive a message from your friend; this message may go through
intermediate agents.

<p>
In one of the exercises we'll look at knowledge when agents have
clocks that may drift from each other but are not more than a some
constant \(M\) units apart. If your friend knows that you will be in
the library till her watch reads 9:00 pm, and your watches may drift apart
by a minute, then you can leave the library at 9:01 pm. Clocks are
useful even if they aren't perfect. More about clocks later.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Theorem: Communication to learn about
Change</h3>
This theorem is similar to the "knowledge is control" theorem.

<p>
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be agents in a system, and let \(P\) be a
predicate on the states of \(y\).
Let \(T\) and \(T'\) be instants in a trajectory with \(T < T'\). If
\(\neg P\) holds at \(T\) and \(x\) knows \(P\) at \(T'\) then there
is a path in the timeline diagram from point \(T\) on \(y\)'s timeline
to point \(T'\) on \(x\)'s timeline.

<h5  style="color:red;">Example</h5>
In the figure below, agent \(C\) holds a token at point \(T\).
At a later point \(T'\) agent \(A\) knows that agent \(C\) holds no
tokens. What must happen between points \(T\) and \(T'\)?

There must be a path in the timeline diagram from point \(T\) on agent
\(C\)'s timeline to point \(T'\) on agent \(A\)'s timeline. This path
is represented by edges that show time elapsing on a timeline and
message edges between timelines.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">What Agents Know about Channel States</h3>
Next, let's look at systems in which messages are acknowledged.
For a pair of agents \(x, y\), let \(ms\) and \(mr\)
be the number of messages that \(x\) has sent to \(y\), and  the number 
of messages that \(y\) has received from \(x\), respectively.
Let \(as\) and \(ar\) be
the number of acknowledgements that \(y\) has sent to \(x\), and
the number of acknowledgements that \(x\) has received from \(y\),
respectively.

The following is an invariant:
<p>
\(ms \geq mr \geq as \geq ar \)

<p>
The number of messages in the channel from \(x\) to \(y\) is \(ms -
mr\).
Because \(ms\) and \(ar\) are variables of agent \(x\),
agent \(x\) <i>knows</i> an upper bound,\(\; ms - ar\), on the number of
messages in channel \((x, y)\).
So, \(x\) knows that the channel is empty when \(\; ms = ar\).

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">What an agent cannot know</h3>
An agent cannot know that there are
exactly \(n\) messages in a channel, for \(n > 0\).
You can prove this result using the concept of consistent
cuts. Intuitively, the agent cannot know whether a message is in the
channel or has been received.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Chains of Knowledge</h3>
Let \(x, y, z\) be agents of a system and \(P\) be a predicate on
states of the system. Then the following are all predicates:
<ol>
  <ul>
    \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
  <ul>
    \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
  <ul>
    \(x\) knows that \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
</ol>
The theorems given earlier apply to any predicate. For example, if
\(x\) knows that \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\) at a point \(t\) in a
trajectory, and \(\neg P\) holds at a later point \(t'\)
then there must be path in the timeline diagram from point \(t\) on
\(x\)'s timeline to point \(t'\) on \(z\)'s timeline.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Concurrent Systems with Shared Variables</h5>
The theorems
and proofs given in this module apply to systems with shared
variables, and indeed any system with trajectories that are
representable by timeline diagrams and with consistent cuts.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
Many people working on distributed systems use the phrase "an agent
knows." This module gives a definition of the concept that is
consistent with intuitive definitions of knowledge.
The central idea in this module is the
relationship between what agents know and consistent cuts of
timelines. We presented several theorems about agent knowledge which
are intuitive when applied to human agents. The proofs are
straightforward and are all based on consistent cuts of timelines.

<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  Is the following true? Why?
  <p>
  (\(z\) knows \(P\)) and (\(z\) knows \(Q\)) \(\equiv\) \(z\) knows
  \(\(P \wedge Q\))
  </li>
  <li>
  Is the following true? Why?
  <p>
  (\(z\) knows \(P\)) or (\(z\) knows \(Q\)) \(\equiv\) \(z\) knows
  \(\(P \vee Q\))
  </li>
  <li>
  Suppose you and your friend communicate only using messages sent in
  channels, just as agents do in our model of distributed
  systems. When you <i>know</i> that your friend is wearing a cap does
  that mean that (a) your friend is wearing a cap, and (b) your friend
  can't take the cap off until the friend hears from you?
