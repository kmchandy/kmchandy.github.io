    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What Agents Know</h1>

  <p class="w3-text-red">
  Programmers often use phrases such as "this agent knows that the
  other agent is idle" or "in the algorithm the detector agent must
  learn that all channels are empty." This page gives a formal
  definition for the frequently used informal phrase: "An agent
  <i>knows</i> something about other agents and and channels." 
  </p>


    <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Key Idea</h3>
    We sometimes use anthropmorphic arguments in reasoning about
    systems --- we invest digital
    agents with human characteristics. For example, a programmer may
    say "an agent <i>knows</i> that another agent is idle." Endowing software with
  human capabilities can be dangerous when terms are ambiguous.
  This page defines the phrase "what an agent knows" and presents
    theorems about knowledge in distributed systems.

  
    <h5 class="w3-text-teal">Predicates and Truth Sets</h5>
    In this module we define a predicate "agent \(x\)
  knows \(P\)" where \(P\) is a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">
  predicate</a> on states of a system.

  <p>
  The phrase
    "predicate \(P\) holds in state \(S\)" means that \(P(S)\) evaluates
    to True in state \(S\) of the system. Associated with each
  predicate \(P\) is the set 
    of states in which \(P\) holds; this set is called "the truth set
  of the predicate."
  
  <p>
  When the domain of discourse is the set of all people, "is a
  student" is a predicate, and the truth set of this predicate is the
  subset of people who are students.
  For a predicate \(P\), the truth set of \(\neg P\), where \(\neg\)
  means NOT, is the complement of the truth set of \(P\).
  
  <p>
  For example, the truth set of \(P \wedge Q\)
  (where \(\wedge\) is boolean <i>AND</i>) is
    the intersection of the truth set of \(P\) and the truth set of
  \(Q\).
  Likewise, the truth set of \(P \vee Q\)
  (where \(\vee\) is boolean <i>OR</i>) is
    the union of the truth set of \(P\) and the truth set of
  \(Q\).

    <p>
This module presents theorems about what agents know.
We restrict attention to what a single agent knows about the
states of other agents and the states of channels between the other
agents.
We can define what collections of agents know about other agents, but
here we restrict attention to what a single agent knows.
Also, we won't consider what an agent knows about itself or about
channels incident on the agent itself.
We study what an agent knows about the rest of the system.

<h2 class="w3-text-teal">What do Programmers mean by "Agent Knows?"</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<p>
  We begin with examples and an informal discussion of the phrase "what an
  agent knows." Later, we will define the phrase and give theorems
  about knowledge. The proofs are based on dataflow graphs.


<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h4  style="color:red;">Example: Four-Way Handshake</h4>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
A system consists of a controller and a furnace.
The furnace is in one of two states: the furnace is either on or the
furnace is off.
The controller sends messages to the furnace to turn the furnace off
or on.
The controller has four states S0, S1, S2, S3.



<!------------------FIGURE 2----------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="HowProcessesLearn.002.jpeg" alt="Fig1" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 2. Example of a Controller of a Furnace</figcaption>
</figure>
<!----------------------------------------------->

<p>
The controller is represented in the diagram by agent C, and the
furnace by agent F. There are channels in both directions between the
agents.

<p>
The diagram on the top left shows a system state in which the
controller is in state S0, and the furnace is on, and both channels
are empty.
In state S0 the controller knows that the furnace is on.
The controller makes a transition from S0 to S1 by sending a message
"turn off" message to the furnace. (The controller receives a message
from itself that causes the transition, and internal messages are not
shown.)

<p>
The diagram in the middle of the top row shows a system state in which
the controller is in state S1, the furnace is on, and there is a
message "turn off" from the controller to the furnace, and the channel
from the furnace to the controller is empty.
In state S1 the controller doesn't know whether the furnace is off or
on because the controller doesn't know whether the "turn off" message
has reached the furnace.

<p>
When the "turn off" message reaches the furnace, the furnace turns
off, and sends a message "furnace turned off" to the controller.
The diagram on the right-hand side of the top row shows a system state
in which the controller is in state S1, the furnace is off, there is a
message "furnace turned off" from the furnace to the controller, and there is
no message from the controller to the furnace.

<p>
When the controller receives the message that the furnace has been
turned off the controller transits to
state S2 in which it knows that the furnace is turned off.
The diagram at the right-hand side of the bottom row shows a system
state in which the controller is in state S2, the furnace is turned
off, and both channels are empty.

<p>
The controller transits from state S2 to S3 when it sends a message to
the furnace to turn on.
When the controller is in state S3 it doesn't know whether the furnace
is on or off. The diagram in the middle of the bottom row shows a
state in which there is a turn-on message from the controller to the
furnace, the controller is in state S3, the furnace is turned off, and
there is no message from the furnace to the controller.

<p>
When the furnace receives the turn-on message the furnace turns
itself on and sends a message to the controller "furnace turned on."
The diagram at the left-hand side of the bottom row shows a system
state in which the furnace is turned on, there is message from the
furnace to the controller that the furnace is on, the controller is in
state S3, and the channel from the controller to the furnace is empty.

<p>
When the controller receives the message that the furnace is on, the
controller transits back to state S0 in which it knows that the
furnace is turned on. The figure below shows the states and state
transitions of the controller.



<!------------------FIGURE 3----------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="HowProcessesLearn.003.jpeg" alt="Fig3" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 3. States of the Controller</figcaption>
</figure>
<!----------------------------------------------->


<p>
Here are a couple of questions to check your reading of the example:
In what states does the controller know that both channels are empty?
In what states does the controller know that the channel from the
controller to the furnace contains a message?

<p>
The controller knows that both channels are empty in states S0 and S2.
There is no state in which the controller knows that the channel from
the controller to the furnace contains a message. The controller
cannot know that the channel contains a message.


<p>
We will say that the controller is uncertain whether the furnace is
off or on when controller doesn't know that the furnace is on and the
controller also doesn't know that the furnace is off. We can combine
the two states in which the controller is uncertain into a single state.

<!-----------------------------FIGURE 4 ------------------------->

    <figcaption>Fig. 4. Alternative States and Transitions of the Controller</figcaption>
</figure>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

The 4-step sequence of messages between the two agents is called a
"four-way handshake" in communication protocols and asynchronous
circuit design.


<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Step in which Agent sends no Messages
to other Agents</h4>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

Let's look at another example, see figure 4.  The diagram on the
left-hand side shows a system state in which (1) the controller (C) knows
that the furnace is off and that the furnace temperature is less than
2000 degrees; (2) the furnace is off and its temperature is less than 1000
degrees; (3) there is a message from the furnace to the controller saying
that the temperature has dropped to 1000; and (4) there is no message from
the controller to the furnace.

<!----------------------FIGURE 5 -------------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="HowProcessesLearn.005.jpeg" alt="Fig4" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 5. An Agent does not Lose Knowledge when it
    Receives a Message</figcaption>
</figure>
<!------------------------------------------------------>


<p>
Let's look at the step in which 
the controller receives the message that the temperature has
dropped to 1000 degrees.
In this step the controller sends no messages to other agents.
(The controller may send a message to itself, and self-messages aren't
shown in the diagram.)

<p>
The knowledge that the controller had before
it received the message -- i.e., the temperature is below 2000 -- is
retained after the message is received. The controller now knows more,
i.e., that the temperature is below 1000, but the controller does not
lose the knowledge that it had before the message arrived.
We will prove a theorem that an agent does not lose knowledge when it
carries out a step in which it sends no messages.
As we see an agent may gain knowledge when it receives messages.




<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h4 style="color:red;">Example: Step in which Agent receives no Messages
from other Agents</h4>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

<p>
Let's look at another example, see figure 6. In this example a
controller (C) controls a furnace and a valve. In the diagram on the
left-hand side the controller knows that the furnace is on and the
valve is closed.

<!----------------------FIGURE 6 -------------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="HowProcessesLearn.006.jpeg" alt="Fig6" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 6. An Agent does not gain knowledge when it takes
a step in which it receives no messages from other agents.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<!------------------------------------------------------>


Let's look at a step of the controller in which the
controller receives a message from itself (not shown in the diagram)
and the controller sends a message "open valve" to the valve.
The controller transitions to a state in which it knows that the
furnace is on and is uncertain about whether the valve is open or
closed.

<p>
An agent can lose knowledge when it sends a
message -- for example, the controller lost the knowledge that the
valve is closed. An agent cannot gain knowledge in a step in which it sends
messages but does not receive messages from other agents: If the agent
knows that the furnace is on after it sent the
message then the agent knew that the furnace was on before
it sent the message.



<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<h3 style="color:red;">Example: What an Agent Doesn't Know</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------>

<p>
A programmer may use a phrase such as "agent X doesn't know that agent
Y is idle when X is active." She probably means:
<p>
NOT (X knows Y is idle) when X is active.
<p>
She probably does not mean:
X knows Y is NOT idle holds when X is active.

<p>
For any agent X and predicate P on states of channels and states of
agents other than X:
<p>
if "X knows NOT P" then NOT ("X knows P").
<p>
We saw in the examples that there may be states of X in which X is
uncertain about P; these are states in which NOT ("X knows
P") and also NOT("X knows NOT P").

<p>
Next, let's give a formal structure to our intuitive understanding.


<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="w3-text-teal">What an Agent Knows: Theory</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------>

Recall that a system state is a tuple with an element of the tuple for
each agent and each channel in the system.
Let \(S_{x}\) be the state of agent \(x\) when the system state is
\(S\).


<p>
Let \(x\) be an agent and let \(P\) be a predicate.
"\(x\) knows \(P\)" is a predicate on the states of agent \(x\).

<p>
\(x\) knows \(P\) holds in a state \(s\) of agent \(x\)
exactly when for all states \(S\) of all computations that start from
an initial state:
<hr class="new2">
<center>
<h5 style="color:blue;">
if \(S_{x} = s\) then \(P\) holds in \(S\).
</h5>
</center>
<hr class="new2">

<p>
When we use the phrase "X knows P" we restrict attention to predicates
P on states of agents other than X itself and on channels between
agents other than X. We are concerned with what X knows about other
parts of the system.



<!---------------------------------------->
<h4  style="color:red;">Example</h4>
In figure 1, the controller is agent C, and let P be the predicate
"furnace is on".
The predicate P holds in the three system states marked "furnace is
on" in the figure.
P holds in all system states in which C is in state S0.
Therefore C knows P when C is in state S0.

<p>
Does C know P when C is in state S1?
When C is in state S1 the system state may be either the state shown
in the diagram in the middle or the right of the top row of figure
1. P does not hold in one of the system states. Therefore
C knows P is false when C is in state S1.

<h4  style="color:red;">Example</h4>
This example shows a system with two agents, X and Y, and channels in
both directions between them. The system has two tokens. A token is
either in a channel or held by an agent. The diagram shows some (but
not all) of the system states.


<!----------------------FIGURE 7 -------------------------------->
<figure>
    <img src="HowProcessesLearn.007.jpeg" alt="Fig7" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Fig. 7. Example: System with Two Agents and Two Tokens</figcaption>
</figure>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->



The set of system states in which X holds both tokens consists of the
single state shown in the left-hand side of the bottom row in which Y
holds no tokens. Therefore, X knows that Y holds no tokens when X
holds both tokens.

<p>
In what states of X does X know that Y holds 0 or 1 tokens? The system
states in which X holds 1 token has the other token in a channel (in
which case Y holds 0 tokens) or is held by Y. Likewise, when X holds
both tokens, Y holds 0 tokens. So, X knows that Y holds at most 1 token
exactly when X holds at least one token.

<p>
In what states does X know that Y holds one token?
There is no state of X in which X knows that Y holds one token.
This is because if X holds 0 tokens or 1 token then the other tokens
may be in channels and so Y may hold no token.
<p>
<i>X cannot know that Y holds a token.</i> i.e.,
<p>
NOT("X knows Y holds a token")


<h4  style="color:red;">Example</h4>
Figure 8 shows the dataflow graph of the example illustrated by figure
1.
The top horizontal line of the dataflow graph has steps of the
controller C, and the lower line has steps of the furnace F.

<p>
The controller knows that the furnace is on between steps 1 and 2.
The controller sends the turn-off message in step 2, and the message
is received by the furnace in step 3. When the furnace receives the
message it turns the furnace off and sends a message that the furnace
is off. The controller receives the message in step 4.

<p>
What the controller knows about the state of the furnace at different
steps in the computation is shown in
the figure. The controller knows that the furnace is on, then is
uncertain, then knows that the furnace is off, then is uncertain, and
then knows again that the furnace is off.

Assume \(x\) knows \(P\) at a point \((e, e')\) in a system

Then \(x\) knows \(P\) holds in state \(s*\).

<p>
Let \(S\) be the state of a consistent cut through the point, and let

Then \(S_{x} = s*\).

Because \(x\) knows \(P\) when \(x\) is in state

If \(C\) knows predicate \(P\) at point  \((e, e')\) in the

<!-------------------------------------------------------------->


The figure shows a part of a dataflow graph of a computation with
steps 1, 2,..7 and agents C, U, V. Steps 2, 5, and 7 are at agent C;
steps 1, 4 and 6 are at agent U; and step 3 is at agent V. The message
sent in step 4 by U is received in step 5 by C.

<p>
Let P be a predicate on the states of U, V and the
channels between U, V. The theorem says that if "C knows P" holds
at point (2, 5), i.e., after step 2 and before step 5, then "C knows
P" holds at point (5, 7), i.e. after step 5 and before step 7.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Proof of Theorem</h5>
Let \(s*\) be \(C\)'s state at point \((e', e'')\).
We will show that \(P\) holds in all states \(S\) in all computations
that start in an initial state, where the state
\(S_{C}\) of agent \(C\)  is \(s*\) when the the system state is \(S\).

<p>
Consider the dataflow graph of any computation that starts in an
initial state.
Let \(e, e', e''\) be successive steps at an agent \(C\) in a
computation, where \(C\) knows predicate \(P\) at point  \((e, e')\).
We will show that \(P\) holds in all states at consistent cuts through
the point \((e', e'')\).

<p>
Let <code>(past, future)</code> be any consistent cut through \((e',
e'')\). 
Let <code>past*</code> be the set of steps identical to
<code>past</code> except that \(e'\) is not in <code>past*</code>.
There is no edge from \(e'\) to steps in <code>past</code>, and
therefore the cut <code>(past*, future*)</code> is consistent.

<p>
The cut <code>(past*, future*)</code> passes through edge \((e,
e')\). \(C\) knows \(P\) at point  \((e, e')\) and therefore \(P\)
holds at the cut <code>(past*, future*)</code>.

<p>
The event of all agents other than \(C\) are the same in
<code>past</code> and <code>past*</code>.
Because \(P\) holds at cut <code>(past*,
future*)</code> it follows that \(P\) also holds at cut <code>(past,
future)</code>.
Therefore, \(P\) holds at all consistent cuts through point \((e',
e'')\). 


<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
Consider a consistent cut through point (5, 7) in the figure, such as
the cut shown by the red dotted line. <code>past</code> at this cut is
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and <code>past*</code> is {1, 2, 3, 4}. It is obvious
that all edges to <code>past*</code> are from <code>past*</code>. So,
the cut specified by <code>past*</code> = {1, 2, 3, 4} is
consistent. In the figure, the cut corresponding to the steps to the
left of the black dotted line is consistent.

<p>
The states of agents U, V are the same after events {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
and events {1, 2, 3, 4} have been executed.


<!--------------------------------->
<h4 class="w3-text-teal">An Agent Can Gain Knowledge Only
When It Receives a Message from Another Agent</h4>

<p class="w3-text-teal">Theorem</p>

Let \(e, e', e''\) be successive steps at an agent \(C\) in a computation.
If \(C\) knows predicate \(P\) at point  \((e', e'')\) in the
dataflow graph of the computation, and if \(C\) receives no messages from
other agents in step \(e'\), then \(C\) also knows \(P\) at point
\((e, e')\).

<p class="w3-text-teal">Proof</p>
The proof uses dataflow graphs in the same way as in the proof of the
previous theorem.

<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
In the figure below, the theorem says that if \(C\) knows \(P\) at
point (5, 7) in the dataflow graph then \(C\) knows \(P\) at point (2,
5). Because \(C\) knows \(P\) at (5, 7) it follows that \(P\) holds
at the cut shown by the vertical black dotted line in which
<code>past</code> is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

<p>
The cut {1, 2, 3, 4} is also consistent. The states of U, V are the
same after events {1, 2, 3, 4} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are executed. So,
if \(P\) holds after {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} then it also holds after {1, 2,
3, 4}.

The theorem says that data must flow from a step in which predicate Q
  changes value to the step in which agent C knows that Q's value has
  changed. 

<p  style="color:red;">Example</p>
Q is the predicate: furnace is on.
Let S1, S2, and S3 be the states shown in the diagrams at the
bottom-right, bottom-left, on top-left respectively.
Steps e and e' take the system from S1 to S2, and from S2 to S3,
respectively.

<p>
NOT Q holds in S3 and C knows Q holds in S1.
The theorem says that there exists a path in the dataflow graph from
step e to step e'.

The figure below illustrates the theorem.
Q is a predicate on the states of agent V.
NOT Q holds before step 4 at V and Q holds after step 4.

<p>
C knows Q after step 7. The theorem says there exists a path in the
dataflow graph from step 4 to step 7.

<h4 class="w3-text-teal">Dual Theorem about Flow of Data to Lose
Knowledge</h4>
Let Q be a predicate and C an agent.
  If C knows Q before a step e in a computation and NOT Q holds
  after a later step e' then there is a path from e to e' in the
  dataflow graph.

The theorem says that if an agent X knows that a predicate P holds for
an agent Y then Y cannot make a state transition that falsifies P
without "permission" from X -- data must flow from X to Y before Y can
enter a state in which P is False.


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Chains of Knowledge</h3>
Let \(x, y, z\) be agents of a system and \(P\) be a predicate on
states of the system. Then the following are all predicates:
<ol>
  <ul>
    \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
  <ul>
    \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
  <ul>
    \(x\) knows that \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\)
  </ul>
</ol>
The theorems given earlier apply to any predicate. For example, if
\(x\) knows that \(y\) knows that \(z\) knows \(P\) at a point \(t\) in a
trajectory, and \(\neg P\) holds at a later point \(t'\)
then there must be path in the timeline diagram from point \(t\) on
\(x\)'s timeline to point \(t'\) on \(z\)'s timeline.

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Summary</h3>
Many people working on distributed systems use the phrase "an agent
knows." This module gives a definition of the concept that is
consistent with intuitive definitions of knowledge.
The central idea in this module is the
relationship between what agents know and consistent cuts of
timelines. We presented several theorems about agent knowledge which
are intuitive when applied to human agents. The proofs are
straightforward and are all based on consistent cuts of timelines.

<h4 style="color:blue;">Review</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  Is the following true? Why?
  <p>
  (\(z\) knows \(P\)) and (\(z\) knows \(Q\)) \(\equiv\) \(z\) knows
  \(\(P \wedge Q\))
  </li>
  <li>
  Is the following true? Why?
  <p>
  (\(z\) knows \(P\)) or (\(z\) knows \(Q\)) \(\equiv\) \(z\) knows
  \(\( P \vee Q\))
  </li>
  <li>
  Suppose you and your friend communicate only using messages sent in
  channels, just as agents do in our model of distributed
  systems. When you <i>know</i> that your friend is wearing a cap does
  that mean that (a) your friend is wearing a cap, and (b) your friend
  can't take the cap off until the friend hears from you?
